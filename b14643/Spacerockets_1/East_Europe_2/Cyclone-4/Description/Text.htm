create the Cyclone-4 complex at the Brazilian space center. A joint venture will 
be set up under the project that will include Ukraine&#39;s Yuzhny Machine Building

old stage of the Tsiklon-3 with increased propellant stock and the main engine on

The Cyclone-4 first stage consists of an interstage section, oxidizer and fuel tanks, 
equipment and aft bays, main engine and steering engine. The Guidance, Navigation 
and Control (GNC) system, the measurement system and the avionics system are accommodated 
in the equipment and aft bays. <br>
The propellant tanks are cylindrical vessels with hemispherical ends. The oxidizer 
feed pipeline reaches the main engine through a tunnel in the fuel tank. The main 
engine, steering engines, and solid retrorockets are located in the aft bay. The 
retrorockets break the first stage at separation from the second stage. The bulkhead 
rigidly fixes the main engine to the lower end frame of the fuel tank.<br>
The main engine consists of three two-chamber liquid rocket engines. The main engine 
is designed as three identical two-chamber engines attached to a common frame. The 
steering engine is a four-chamber liquid rocket engine with a turbo-pump feed system. 
The pneumo-hydraulic system supplies propellants to the main and steering engines. 
Pivoting the steering engine combustion chambers within ± 41° controls the first 
stage flight.<br>
The second stage consists of an interstage section, propellant tank and aft bay, 
main engine and steering engine. The GNC, Measurement System and Safety System instrumentation 
(avionics system) is accommodated in the equipment and aft bays. <br>
The propellant tank is an all-welded cylindrical vessel with spherical ends, divided 
into an upper oxidizer compartment and a lower fuel compartment with an intermediate 
bulkhead. The oxidizer feed pipeline is located inside the fuel tank.<br>
The main and steering engines and solid retrorockets are located in the aft bay. 
The retrorockets break the second stage at separation from the third stage. The 
bulkhead rigidly fixes the main engine to the lower end frame of the propellant 
tank.<br>
The main engine is a two-chamber liquid rocket engine. The steering engine is a 
four-chamber liquid rocket engine with a turbo-pump feed system. The pneumo-hydraulic 
system supplies propellants to the main and steering engines. Pivoting the steering 
engine combustion chambers within ± 30° controls the second stage flight.<br>
The third stage consists of a propellant tank, main engine, liquid jet system (LJS), 
pneudraulic system, and GNC, Measurement and Safety System instrumentation (avionics 
system). The main component of the third stage is the propellant tank. <br>
<br>
The propellant tank is an all-welded sphere-cone tight vessel consisting of two 
compartments: <br>
– spherical oxidizer compartment, and<br>
– conical fuel compartment.<br>
The main engine is aligned with the third stage longitudinal axis and fixed to the 
lower frame of the propellant tank by the bulkhead. The main engine is a liquid 
rocket engine with a turbo-pump feed system. The pressure vessels and LJS propellant 
tanks are located on the upper side of the propellant tank. The units for separation 
of the pneudraulic pipelines between the third stage and the interstage are mounted 
on the spacer ring of the conical fuel compartment.<br>
The equipment bay is a conical compartment accommodating the GNC, Measurement and 
Safety System instrumentation. Quick disconnect boards of the third stage and interstage, 
and the thermal conditioning system inlets and outlets are placed on the outside 
of the equipment bay. Pivoting the main engine combustion chamber and LJS operation 
control the third stage flight.<br>
The liquid jet system serves for: <br>
– the generation of control forces to provide angular attitude control during coast 
flight;<br>
– the generation of control forces in the roll axis at powered flight;<br>
– the generation of axial accelerations to ensure propellant continuity at the ME 
inlet before startup;<br>
– third stage attitude control required for spacecraft separation;<br>
– stage attitude control before deorbiting;<br>
– stage stabilization during deorbiting;<br>
– the generation of the injection trajectory and provision of the required injection 
accuracy.<br>
<br>
After the engine shutdown, the third stage continues coasting, and the LJS provides 
stabilization. Before the main engine re-ignitions, the LJS generates a preburning 
axial acceleration. Duration of the acceleration is selected to ensure propellant 
transfer to the capillary intaker, damping of the propellant sloshing, and extraction 
of the gas inclusions from the propellant. After termination of the main engine 
operation, when the third<br>
stage approaches the target point, the LJS provides the required accuracy of spacecraft 
injection. Then the stage performs a collision and contamination avoidance maneuver.<br>
The LJS uses the same propellant components as the third stage main engine (NTO 
and UDMH). The LJS thruster has a nominal thrust of 3 kgf, and the system has an 
operating life of 6 hours. The LJS starts functioning after the second and third 
stage separation. <br>
During operation of the third stage main engine, the LJS is responsible for controlling 
the third stage roll movement. After the third stage main engine shutdown, the LJS 
is responsible for the stabilization and angular attitude control during coast flight. 
Before re-ignition of the third stage main engine, the LJS generates axial accelerations 
to ensure propellant continuity at the main engine inlet by damping the propellant 
sloshing and reducing gas inclusions in the propellant. <br>
After the end of the third stage main engine operation, close to the satellite orbit 
insertion point, the LJS is responsible for controlling the third stage attitude, 
for guaranteeing the precise orbit insertion, and for performing a maneuver to avoid 
collision with the satellite and to avoid satellite contamination. The LJS is also 
responsible for controlling the third stage reentry. <br>
<br>
The payload unit (PLU) is the launch vehicle compartment designed for transporting 
and protecting the spacecraft. The payload unit consists of a payload fairing, spacecraft 
adapter, and payload unit adapter. The payload fairing and the payload unit adapter 
form an isolated environment in which the thermal, humidity and cleanness conditions 
are controlled according to international ISO 14644-1 standards. The controlled 
characteristics air supply to the PLU is performed by an air-conditioning system 
on the ground or by a compressed air system. <br>
The payload unit adapter is a conic structure of aluminum alloys with thermal insulation 
on its exterior. The adapter is bolted to the third stage. The adapter is 725 mm 
high and the upper radius is 2,660 mm. A spacecraft adapter for one satellite or 
a dispenser for multiple satellites can be attached to the upper radius.<br>
The spacecraft adapters and dispensers connect satellites to the launch vehicle 
and perform the satellite separation with the required parameters after reaching 
the desired orbit. The spacecraft adapters and dispensers can be designed by Yuzhnoye 
or by the launch service client. The user manual provides more details and dimensions 
of some of the available standard dispensers.<br>
The payload fairing protects the satellite from aerodynamic and thermal loads during 
liftoff and atmospheric flight of the launch vehicle. Together with the payload 
unit adapter, it isolates the satellite in a controlled temperature, humidity and 
cleanness environment. There are two types of fairing. Type 00 which is 8.59 meters 
long, and Type 01 which is 9.59 meters long. <br>
<br>
The PLF is jettisoned during the second stage flight after the dynamic pressure 
is safe for the satellite. The PLF structure consists of two half shells which are 
linked together by locking mechanisms. The GNC system commands the split of the 
vertical interface between the two PLF shells. Then, pneumopushers force the half 
shells to hinge until the center of gravity of each shell passes its neutral axis. 
From then on, the half shells rotate under g-load approximately 60° when the hinges 
break up and the shells continue in free fall. It is guaranteed that the fairing 
will not come into contact with payloads whose dimensions are within the specifications 
required by Yuzhnoye. <br>
