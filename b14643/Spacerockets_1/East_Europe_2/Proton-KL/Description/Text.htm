<p><font color="#000080">In 2016, Russian space officials announced plans to develop 
a smaller version of the nation&#39;s venerable Proton launch vehicle. The head of Roskosmos 
Igor Komarov, speaking to a radio station&nbsp; on June 18 said that the Proton-Light 
variant would be narrowly aimed at particular demands of the commercial market. 
According to Komarov, an extra variant would make the Proton family more effective 
and reduce per-kilogram cost of payload delivered into orbit.<br>
<br>
On June 23, the head of GKNPTs Khrunichev Andrei Kalinovsky announced that the company 
had been preparing a new addition to the Proton family for a different type of commercial 
spacecraft, allowing various Proton variants to have their own individual price 
offers on the market.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Around the same time, various industry sources revealed 
the most likely architecture of the Proton-Light rocket. The key change included 
the removal of the second stage from the standard Proton-M rocket. Instead, the 
traditional third stage of the Proton-M would be &quot;stretched&quot; to accommodate more 
propellant and used as the second stage on the Proton-Light. According to some reports, 
the propulsion system on the second stage could be modified to re-start its engine 
and boost its payload from an initial parking orbit to a geostationary transfer 
orbit, GTO.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">On Sept. 13, 2016, GKNPTs Khrunichev officially confirmed 
its plans to expand the Proton family and announced the coming of its additional 
members.<br>
One new version of the launcher now identified as </font><font color="#FF0000">Proton-Light</font><font color="#000080"> 
would be formed by the removal of two out of six strap-on tanks and their respective 
engines on the first stage and by the addition of an auxiliary fuel tank at the 
top of its main body.<br>
The company promised to introduce that latest configuration of the vehicle in 2019, 
or one year after the &quot;original&quot; Proton-Light architecture, which was now renamed
</font><font color="#FF0000">Proton-Medium.</font></p>

<p><font color="#800080"><b>2018, June -- Mr. Rogozin, as general director of Roskosmos, 
has given an order to wind-down manufacturing of &quot;Proton&quot; launch system, upon completion 
of current manifest, and retire the launcher. Angara will come as a replacement.</b></font></p>
