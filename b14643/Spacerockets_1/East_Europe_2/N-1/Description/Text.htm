The originally </font><b><font color="#FF0000">N-1</font></b><font color="#000080"> 
was intended to launch heavy satellites into Earth orbit. In consisted of three 
stage all using liquid oxygen and kerosene propellants. The N-1 heavy-lift contained 
six spherical tanks (two on each of the first three cone-shaped stages), the fuel 
tank being above the oxidiser tank. These tanks were produced from magnesium-nickel 
alloy AGM6, and the N-1 external construction was duralumin D16.<br>
<br>
The first stage , Block A, had 30 engines, arranged in circles of 24 and 6. The 
engines </font><font color="#FF0000"><b>NK-15</b></font><font color="#000080"> were 
developed by the Kuznetsov Design Bureau. The engines could not be gimballed to 
steer the vehicle. Instead, the motors were selectively throttled to achieve the 
correct trajectory. The 30 main engines (+4 drive engines) have a thrust of 154 
tons each and burning 150 seconds. The first stage had&nbsp; a 12.9 m diameter LOX 
tank and a 10 m diameter fuel tank. On the&nbsp; lower part of this stage were installed 
4 grating-type stabilizers. <br>
The second stage, Block B, featured 8&nbsp; Kuznetsov engines </font>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>NK-15V</b></font><font color="#000080">. The engines differed 
slightly from those on the first stage in that they had longer nozzles for better 
performance at higher altitudes. Again , guidance was achieved through selective 
throttling. The 8&nbsp; engines have a thrust of 179 tons each. The second stage 
had a 8 m diameter LOX-tank and a 7 m diameter fuel tank. <br>
The third stage, Block W, employed four engines </font><font color="#FF0000"><b>
NK-19</b></font><font color="#000080">&nbsp; (later </font>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>NK-39</b></font><font color="#000080">) of different design. 
The third stage engines could be gimballed and have a thrust of 41.5 tons each. 
The stage had&nbsp; a 5.8 m diameter LOX tank and a 4.7 m diameter fuel tank.
<br>
This was the basic N-1 vehicle. The lunar program required the addition of two more 
rocket stages, a lunar lander and a spacecraft for the return to Earth. These components 
came under the name L-3. The program as a whole was known as N-1/L-3.<br>
The next stage (Block G) concerned the lunar spacecraft and had a total mass to 
98 tons. Each block had only one engine </font><font color="#FF0000"><b>NK-21
</b></font><font color="#000080">(later </font><b><font color="#FF0000">NK-31</font></b><font color="#000080"><b>)</b>, 
a toroidal fuel tank and a cylindrical oxidiser tank. This block is for acceleration 
and next Block D (engine </font><font color="#FF0000"><b>RD-58</b></font><font color="#000080">) 
for deceleration near the moon. The last&nbsp; was connected with Lunar Orbital 
Cabin (LOK) and Lunar Cabin (LK). On the top of the N-1 booster was installed a 
10 m long solid rocket launch escape system with a mass of 7 tons. The L-3 composition 
is 43.7 m long, the total booster mass is 2.788 tons. <br>
The N-1 booster had a built-in safety failure system (KORD) which controlled each 
engine in each stage. If 4 engines in the first stage&nbsp; failed the rocket would 
still work, likewise, if a pair of engines in the second stage or one engine in 
the third stage failed, the N-1 was still capable of reaching low Earth orbit.
<br>
The </font><b><font color="#FF0000">N-1/3L</font></b><font color="#000080"> was 
finally ready for its first test flight in 1969. The booster was to carry a Soyuz-LOK 
and a mock-up of the Lunar Cabin, but 70 seconds after lift-off on February 21 the 
rocket failed:</font></font></p>

  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" dir="ltr">
  <font size="2" color="#000080">The first&nbsp; N-1 booster lifted off on 21.02.1969. 
  First stage ignition occurred at T-4 seconds. Engine no.12 and 24 shutdown after 
  3-7 seconds because of on error in the KORD control system. The flight was able 
  to continue because the remaining engines compensated for the failure. At&nbsp; 
  T+25 seconds the engines were throttled down until the vehicle safely passed through 
  the period of maximum dynamic pressure. At T+65-66 seconds the engines throttled 
  back to full power but the much faster than had been expected causing strong vibration. 
  The oxidiser pipeline of one engine broke spilling liquid oxygen and a fire broke 
  out. All first stage engines were apparently shut down at T+70.</font></p>

  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" color="#000080">A second&nbsp; 
  launch attempt was made on 03.07.1969. Soon&nbsp; after ignition (6-9 seconds) 
  one of the oxidiser pumps failed, causing the engines to shut down. The rocket 
  fell back towards the launch pad. The launch escape system worked well and the 
  payload was delivered.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" color="#000080">The 
  third launch took place on 27.06.1971. Soon&nbsp; after lift-off at a altitude 
  of about 250 m and 8-10 seconds after ignition the booster guidance system&nbsp; 
  failed and an unplanned rotation about the vertical axis began, causing breakup 
  of the support structure between the second-third stages.</font></p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" color="#000080">The 
  last launch attempt took place on 23.11.1972. The&nbsp; N-1 first stage engines 
  worked well to 107 seconds, but then an unexpected vibration began in the first-second 
  stages causing flight&nbsp; termination about 40 seconds before first stage engines 
  normally shut down. The booster exploded.</font></p>

<p><font color="#800080">In July 1970, Kuznetsov received an order to develop significantly 
improved engines for the first and second stages of the N-1. However, it was to 
take another three years before these engines, designated NK-33 and NK-43, were 
available. They could at first time be used for the N-1F.</font></p>
<p><font color="#800080">Finally five improved NK engines was developed by Kuznetsov:<br>
The new NK-33 and NK-43 engines for the N-1F (upgraded versions of the NK-15 and 
NK-15V).<br>
The NK-31 and NK-39 engines (upgraded versions of the NK-21 and NK-19) and already 
available for the N-1 (6L and 7L).</font></p>
<p><font color="#800080">Two of the N-1F launcher (8L and 9L) had been fully assembled 
and readied on pad for flight. But in 1974 the program was cancelled. The two N-1F 
launcher were scrapped, the engines had previously been removed.</font></p>

variant </font><b><font color="#FF0000">N-1M</font></b>:<font color="#000080"><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The RD-57 (11D57) LH2/LOX engine was developed as a replacement 
for the NK-31 and NK-39<br>
