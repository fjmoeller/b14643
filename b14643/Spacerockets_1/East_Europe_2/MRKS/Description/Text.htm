(MRKS) is a complete new two-stage system. The MRKS is being developed for the Russian 
Federal Space Agency by the Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center.<br>
<br>
The LPRE&#39;s of the system will burn liquid oxygen along with methane or kerosene.<br>
<br>
The MRKS consists as a family of four versions of launch vehicles with maximal two 
RRM&#39;s and two additional boosters that can put up to 60,000 kilograms of payload 
into low-Earth orbit.<br>
<br>
The new &quot;Baikal&quot; flyback booster, called the Re-entry Rocket Module (RRM), is part 
of the MRKS (or Reusable Integrated Launch Vehicle -- RILV). The RRM would be the 
RILV&#39;s first stage.<br>
The RRM &quot;Baikal&quot; probably will have four engines. If one fails during ascent, the 
others will increase their thrust to 130 percent of their normal levels.<br>
After its flight, the RRM will cruise back to its launch site autonomously, using 
a wing, along with airbreathing jet engines located in its nose.</font></p>

<font size="2" color="#800080">On June 4, 2018, the Fund for Prospective Research, 
FPI, within Roskosmos and the United Aviation Development Corporation, announced 
that it had selected a concept for the preliminary design of a returnable booster 
stage intended for a super-light reusable launcher. The proposed system was expected 
to deliver 600 kilograms of payload to the Sun-synchronous orbit. The FPI statement 
said that the design of the future rocket system was based on the technical heritage 
of the Baikal booster, while the accompanying rendering showed a two-stage vehicle 
equipped with a folding wing, practically identical to the architecture formulated 
almost two decades earlier.<br>
The announcement also quoted the head of the design group at FPI, Boris Satovsky, 
as saying that in the course of the pre-preliminary studies, engineers compared 
several alternative aerodynamic architectures and conducted calculations of gas 
dynamics and thermal conditions for the vehicle on the return trajectory. These 
studies proved the availability of the necessary technical expertise for the development 
of a demonstrator, Satovsky said.<br>
According to preliminary estimates, the reusable system will cut the cost of payload 
delivery by 1.5 or 2 times compared to traditional rockets. Every self-guided booster 
will be designed to fly 50 missions without replacement of its main engines burning 
a mix of </font><font size="2" color="#FF0000">cryogenic liquid oxygen and liquid 
methane</font><font size="2" color="#800080">. The system was expected to be based 
on mobile launchers and its maiden flight was scheduled for 2022, the FPI press 
release said.</font><br>
