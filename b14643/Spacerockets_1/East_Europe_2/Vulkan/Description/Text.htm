<font color="#000080" size="2">The Vulkan rocket was created according to the five 
year plan of researches and experiments studies ratified by the Soviet government 
in July, 1981 and by the specifications of the administration headquarters in July, 
1982.<br>
The Vulkan heavy launcher is in the class of unified launcher such as Energya, using 
common engines and rocket blocks unified for the main systems. The first stage consists 
of&nbsp; 8 boosters, block A from the Energya rocket. The second stage, the core 
block, corresponds to the central block of the Energya launcher.<br>
The departure mass of Vulkan is 4.747 t. The capacity of the payload at a 200 km 
height and a slope of 50.7° is 200 t, 172 t for a slope of 97° and&nbsp; 36 t for 
a geostationary orbit with the use of the block &quot;Vesuvius&quot;, 43 t for an orbit towards 
the Moon and until 52 t for a flight towards Mars.<br>
The elements of the block A are attached by 2, and there is 4 pairs. They are longer 
than the block A of Energya. Finally, the boosters are not equipped with return 
system. Block A boosters are divided into 2 groups; left blocks and right blocks; 
the difference is in the positioning of the separation retro-rockets and in the 
fixation elements to the central block.<br>
At the start the mass of each booster block A is 449.2 t, weight of the structure 
is 57.3 t, the mass of fuel is 386 t of which 278.8 t of oxygen and 107.2 t of fuel.
<br>
The boosters of the block A is powered by engines <b>RD-172</b> -- derivative of 
four-chambers engine RD-170 -- which have a thrust of 859.8 t at sea level and 937 
t in vacuum. Their specific impulse&nbsp; is of 308.5 s at sea level and 336.2 s 
in the space.<br>
The central block of the Vulkan launcher distinguishes itself from the core block 
of Energya by a tank&#39;s lengthening, the change of the shape of the bottom of the 
superior oxygen tank, a cylindrical skirt on the engines <b>RD-0120</b> level (4 
units), a symmetric arrangement of the tanks including pipings.<br>
The mass of departure of the core block&nbsp; is 934 t, weight of the structure 
is 89.7 t, the mass of fuel is 832 t of which 713 t of oxygen and 119 t of hydrogen. 
The engine is RD-0120 which has a thrust of 148 t on Earth and 200 t in the vacuum. 
The specific impulse is 336.3 s at sea level and 454.5 s in vacuum.</font></p>
