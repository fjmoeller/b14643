    launch vehicle Cyclone-4M is based in Canada</b></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" color="#000080">The collapse of the Cyclone-4 
    joint venture with Brazilia prompted KB Yuzhnoe to seek new partnerships that 
    would give Cyclone-4 a new launch pad.<br>
    In 2016, the Ukrainian space agency gave formal permission to KB Yuzhnoe to 
    proceed with the development of a joint venture for a new designed Cyclone-4M 
    rocket in North America. <br>
    In February 2017, three US firms formed a joint venture called </font>
    <font size="2" color="#FF0000">Maritime Launch Services, MLS</font><font size="2" color="#000080">, 
    which was based in Halifax, the capital of Nova Scotia. MLS announced that it 
    would build a launch facility in Nova Scotia, for the Cyclone-4M rocket.<br>
    The construction at the spaceport was promised to commence as early as 2018, 
    if the MLS fund-raising effort goes as planned. According to the company, commercial 
    launches from the spaceport could begin in 2019 or 2020.<br>
    <br>
    The Ukraine-based KB Yuzhnoe design bureau began work on the preliminary design 
    of a new launch vehicle.<br>
    <br>
    The architecture of the proposed two-stage Tsiklon-4M (Cyclone-4M) rocket is 
    built around the first stage booster derived from the US Antares and the Ukrainian 
    Zenit rockets and burning liquid oxygen and kerosene. Both stages for Cyclone-4M 
    were developed and produced in the Ukrainian city of Dnepropetrovsk, the home 
    of KB Yuzhnoe.<br>
    <br>
    The architecture of the former Cyclone-4 was drastically re-designed. The original 
    booster stage of the rocket with a diameter of three meters, which was inherited 
    from the Soviet Cyclone-2 and -3 launchers and the R-36 ballistic missile, was 
    abandoned in favor of Zenit&#39;s and Antares&#39; 3.9 meter caliber still in production 
    and using non-toxic propellant.<br>
    <br>
    While retaining the diameter of 3.9 meters inherited from Zenit and Antares, 
    the new first-stage booster of the 39-meter-tall Cyclone-4M will be shorter 
    to optimize it for its new role. According to original plans, the first stage 
    of the new rocket was to be propelled by four modified RD-120 engines borrowed 
    from Zenit&#39;s second stage, replacing the Russian-built RD-171 propulsion system 
    on the first stage of the Zenit.<br>
    <br>
    Although RD-120 was also developed at NPO Energomash in Moscow, it is serially 
    produced in Ukraine and available for the new rocket. However due to a number 
    of Russian parts, it is expected to be upgraded in Ukraine with indigenous components. 
    As of March 2017, plans were made to equip the first stage of Cyclone-4M with 
    a Ukrainian-built engine designated </font><b>
    <font size="2" color="#FF0000">RD-870</font></b><font size="2" color="#000080">, 
    which was previously proposed for the Antares rocket.<br>
    <br>
    The second stage for Cyclone-4M will be borrowed from the third stage of the 
    Cyclone-4 rocket. It will use a hypergolic (or storable) propellant. Although 
    both of its components are toxic, they remove all time limitations of easily 
    evaporating cryogenic propellants. As a result, the upper stage can be restarted 
    multiple times and operate in space almost indefinitely, performing elaborate 
    maneuvers.<br>
    <br>
    The payload fairing for the new rocket will also be borrowed unchanged from 
    Cyclone-4.<br>
    <br>
    The chosen geographical location enables Cyclone-4M to deliver 3,350 kilograms 
    of payload into a near-polar orbit, when launched southward over the Atlantic. 
    Up to 5,000 kilograms could be delivered to a variety of low Earth&#39;s orbits 
    with an altitude up to 600 kilometers.</font></p>
