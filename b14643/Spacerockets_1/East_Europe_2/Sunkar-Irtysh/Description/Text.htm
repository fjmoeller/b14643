<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" color="#000080">In April 2017, the head of RKK 
Energia Vladimir Solntsev told the official TASS news agency that the Sunkar rocket 
would be a preferable launch vehicle for the PTK/Federatsiya new-generation transport 
spacecraft to the Angara-5P rocket. <br>
<br>
In July of the same year, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin promised to complete 
the development of the Irtysh (formerly Sunkar) rocket in 2021 with RKTs Progress 
as the prime contractor. Its development would be funded through the Feniks program.<br>
<br>
According to the newly drafted timeline, beginning in 2022, the Istysh would be 
used to launch the unmanned test version of the PTK/Federatsiya spacecraft, as well 
as future modules for the Russian segment of the ISS. The new rocket would have 
to be certified (or &quot;man-rated&quot;) for the first launch with a crew in 2024.<br>
<br>
The PTK/Federatsiya project previously relied on the man-rated version of the Angara-5 
rocket, after the ship&#39;s originally proposed launcher (Rus-M) had been canceled 
in 2011 while still on the drawing board.<br>
<br>
On August 11, 2017, RKK Energia officially confirmed that it had been working on 
the preliminary design of the Soyuz-5 launch vehicle including its man-rated version 
in cooperation with RKTs Progress and the TsENKI&nbsp; launch infrastructure organization, 
among other subcontractors.<br>
<br>
According to available data from RKK Energia, during a typical mission, the Soyuz-5 
rocket will initially insert the PTK Federatsiya spacecraft into a 200 by 135-kilometer 
orbit with an inclination 51.7 degrees. That inclination matches the latitude of 
Russia&#39;s new spaceport in Vostochny, however it is not expected to have a launch 
facility compatible with the Irtysh rocket until the second half of the 2020s. As 
a result, all early missions of the Irtysh/Sunkar rockets will be originating from 
the refurbished Zenit launch complex in Baikonur.<br>
<br>
After reaching its initial elliptical orbit, the Federatsiya spacecraft will fire 
its own propulsion system at apogee to make it circular at an altitude of 200 kilometers. 
The estimated propellant consumption for this first maneuver is expected to reduce 
the mass of the spacecraft from 16 tons to 15.4 tons.<br>
<br>
Once in its circular orbit, the PTK spacecraft would be able to conduct either an 
autonomous orbital flight or to maneuver still higher to link up with an orbital 
tug or an orbiting space station. The Federatsiya would still need a much larger 
rocket than Soyuz-5 to go anywhere beyond low Earth orbit, which remains the ultimate 
goal of the PTK project.<br>
