</font><font size="2" color="#000080">The Angara rocket family is a family of space-launch 
vehicles currently under development by the Khrunichev State Research and Production 
Space Center. The rockets, which are to provide lifting capabilities between 2,000 
and 40,500 kg into low earth orbit, are intended to become the mainstay of the Russian 
unmanned launcher fleet in the future and replace several existing systems.<br>
Khrunichev has also been developing a super-heavy-lift version (Angara 7), which 
is capable of orbiting payload of between 45 and 75 tons, and for which there is 
no equivalent in Russia&#39;s current rocket fleet. However, currently the development 
of Angara 7 is not receiving government funding. In addition, Khrunichev has offered 
to build a version capable of launching manned spacecraft: Angara 5P. <br>
The Angara rockets have a modular design similar to the Evolved Expendable Launch 
Vehicle, based on a common Universal Rocket Module (URM). Depending on configuration, 
the first stage can consist of 1, 3, 5 or 7 such modules.<br>
The URM is a unitary structure that includes an oxidizer tank, a fuel tank (both 
tanks being coupled by a spacer) and a propulsion bay. Each URM will have one single-chamber
</font><font size="2" color="#FF0000">RD-191</font><font size="2" color="#000080"> 
engine, using liquid oxygen and kerosene as fuel. <br>
The second stage will be either a Breeze-KM (Angara 1.1), Block-I (Angara 1.2) or 
Block IE (also called URM-2), which is powered by a&nbsp; </font>
<font size="2" color="#FF0000">RD-0124A</font><font size="2" color="#000080"> engine 
developed by the KB Khimavtomatika. Angara 5 will use either the Breeze-M upper 
stage (currently used for the Proton-M), or a new KVTK with a </font>
<font size="2" color="#FF0000">RD-0146D</font><font size="2" color="#000080"> engine 
. Most versions are intended for unmanned launches, but Angara A5P is being designed 
to be capable of launching manned spacecraft.<br>
The rockets will be launched from the Plesetsk launch site, and the currently under 
construction Vostochny launch site. Russia hopes to reduce its dependency on Kazakhstan 
for the use of the Tyuratam launch site, the location from which many of the current 
generation of Russian rockets are launched. Under the Baiterek program with Kazakhstan, 
commercial launches of Angara A5 may also take place from Tyuratam cosmodrome. In 
2009, it was reported that a shortage of funds for construction of the Plesetsk 
launch pad was the main obstacle in Angara&#39;s development.<br>
The serial production of the Universal Rocket Modules and the Breeze-M upper stages 
will take place at the Khrunichev subsidiary Production Corporation Polyot in Omsk. 
Design and testing of the RD-191 engine is done by NPO Energomash, while its mass 
production will take place at the company Proton-PM in Perm. <br>
The Angara 1.1 version is expected to be completed first. Its first launch is scheduled 
to take place in 2013 from the Plesetsk cosmodrome.<br>
<br>
Together with NPO Molniya, Khrunichev is also developing the reusable </font>
<font size="2" color="#FF0000">Baikal launch vehicle</font><font size="2" color="#000080">, 
based on Angara&#39;s URM. The vehicle consists of one URM fitted with a wing, an empennage, 
a landing gear, a return flight engine and attitude control thrusters, to enable 
the rocket to return to an airfield after completing its mission. </font></p>

<p><b>Angara 1.2</b></p>
<p><font color="#FF00FF">2022, April 29 -- Russia has successfully launched its 
redesigned Angara 1.2 and placed a payload into orbit. This Angara 1.2 differs from 
its predecessor by having a second stage that is adapted to the diameter of the 
first stage. There is no third stage (Breeze-KM). Instead a new adapter-like AM 
tug is added using 4 maneuver thruster (11D458) from the Breeze with a total 
thrust of 4 x 392 N.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#000080"><b>2014, July 09</b> -- Russia launched its first 
new <b>Angara 1.2PP</b> rocket. A Roscosmos spokesman has told&nbsp; that the launch 
has taken place and that the rocket is functioning normally (?).<br>
The Angara rocket lifted off from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome near Arkhangelsk and will 
fly for 21 minutes on a sub-orbital ballistic trajectory before landing at the Kura 
test-range in the far eastern Kamchatka Peninsula.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#000080"><b>2013, May 24</b> -- Russia&#39;s first light-class 
modification <b>Angara 1.2PP</b> carrier rocket is ready for its maiden launch, 
its manufacturer Khrunichev Center said. The first Angara will be sent to the Plesetsk 
space centre in northern Russia later this month, the manufacturer said in a statement, 
but did not give a precise launch date. Meanwhile, the first heavy-class <b>Angara-A5</b> 
has been completed and will soon be presented to the public, a Khrunichev spokesman 
said. The project is being personally overseen by Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu 
and Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who is in charge of the defense industry. 
Deputy Defence Minister Yury Borisov said earlier in May that the light-class Angara 
would be launched in mid-2014 and its heavy variant towards the end of this year. 
The light-class Angara was initially due to be launched in 2013. Deputy Defence 
Minister Oleg Ostapenko said in April that the new rocket would only be launched 
after the construction of a new launch facility at the Plesetsk space centre is 
completed.</font></p>
