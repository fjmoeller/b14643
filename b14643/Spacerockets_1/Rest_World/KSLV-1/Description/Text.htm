<font color="#000080">KARI and the Ministry of&nbsp; Science &amp; Technology (MOST) 
plan to develop now a national satellite launch vehicle (</font></span><font

class="BL"><font color="#000080">) capable of putting a 100 kg payload into orbit 
by 2009. An upgrade is planned with a payload capability increased to 1,500 kg by 
2015.</font></span></font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font color="#000080">First launch of the new </font>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>KSLV-1</b></font><font color="#000080"> launch vehicle 
(now renamed</font><font color="#FF0000"><b> &quot;Naro&quot;</b></font><font 
color="#000080">) from the new space centre was scheduled for 2009, with completion 
of the spaceport.<br>
The KSLV-1 is consisting of a first stage derived from the Russian Angara launch 
vehicle, and a second stage of South Korean manufacture. The KARI second stage consists 
of a solid motor attached beneath an approximately 2 meter diameter structure that 
houses guidance and flight control equipment. The stage is fitted with 3-axis control 
that allows it to coast if needed. Control is provided by reaction control thrusters.<br>
The Space Rocket Complex (SRC) will comprise a launch vehicle, launch pad and processing 
facilities, ground infrastructure (monitoring assets, power supply, office areas, 
living quarters, roads, etc.) and a mission control center. KhSC will be the lead 
developer of SRC. The Ground Facility will be designed by the Design Bureau for 
Transport Engineering. Energomash will design and produce the engines for the 1st 
Stage of the Launch Vehicle. South Korean companies and organizations will also 
be involved in the design and manufacturing process for different elements of the 
Complex. The Korean Aerospace Research Institute is the Customer in this project.
<br>
The contract will be implemented in three phases. Phase 1 is scheduled to take up 
until 2009 when KSLV-1 is supposed to launch the first satellite from the South 
Korean launch site on the Island of Oe Naro.<br>
The first stage of KSLV is not identically to the Russian Angara. The KSLV uses 
an other Russian engine. The named engine </font><font color="#FF0000"><b>RD-151</b></font><font 
color="#000080"> has 167 tons of thrust (s.l.). This engine is unknown up to now. 
The mysterious RD-151 engine is probably old and was used for a missile, which is 
not known. The Russians give about this no information. The Korean engineers do 
not know the engine and can not consider it also. Nevertheless the RD-151 engine 
is apparent a precursor of the engines RD-170, RD-171, RD-180 and RD-191.</font></font><font

<i>On the 23rd October 2006, <b>Vladimir Nesterov</b>, manager of the Krunichev 
Center in Russia, informed that the Krunichev Center intends to perform the design 
and manufacture work for the KSLV first stage propulsion system. However he also 
revealed that transfer of detailed technology will likely not happen.<br>
Nesterov said that Korea and Russia had entered a contract for development of the 
propulsion system manufacturing technology. &quot;We have obtained a contract to develop 
a first stage propulsion system for a launch vehicle capable of launching a 100kg 
satellite. We will supply components/materials needed for manufacture </i>
</font><i><b><font size="2" color="#000080">without transferring technology</font></b><font

</font></i><font size="2" color="#000080">KSLV first stage is ignited 3.8 sec before 
lift-off and burns 229 sec of the 232 sec before staging utilizing a liquid propellant 
combination of Kerosene and Liquid Oxygen. The rocket endures maxium dynamic pressure 
at 55 sec followed by shroud separation at 215 sec into the launch. The second stage 
395 sec from lift-off ignites after a 163 sec controlled coast utilizing an 8 metric 
tons thrust solid propellant kick motor that burns out at 453 sec with an active 
attitude control system for satellite orbital insertion separation some 540 sec 
after lift-off.</font></p>
<p><b><font size="2" color="#FF0000"><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">**</span></font></b><font 
size="2" color="#000080"> </font><font size="2">There are new conjectures to the 
origin of the engine RD-151. Energomash lists an engine, named <b>RD-150</b>, with 
1.002,6 tons of thrust (s.l.) for a project beginning in the year 1974. Probable 
is these RD-150 a cluster of 6 single engines. These engine was tested in this time.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" color="#000080"><b><u>Naro-3 launch in October 2012</u><br>
</b>Education, Science and Technology Minister Lee Ju-ho has reaffirmed that his 
ministry will make a third attempt to launch Korea’s first rocket into space in 
October as scheduled.<br>
Lee said he made a final check on the assembly of the liquid-fueled first-stage 
rocket when he visited the Khrunichev State Research and Production Spence Center 
in Russia in late May.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#000080">The scheduled launch of the Korean space rocket 
Naro-1 has been postponed again. The launch countdown on 29 November was stopped 
due to problems with a direction controller in the upper second-stage rocket less 
than 17 minutes before lift-off. The first delay of the launch came Oct. 26 about 
five hours before lift-off due to a problem in the first-stage rocket.<br>
<br>
</font><font size="2" color="#800080"><u><b>Naro-3 launch in January 2013</b></u><br>
South Korea is expected to try again to launch its space rocket later this month 
after successfully conducting experiments to check if all systems are working properly.<br>
South Korean engineering workers successfully carried out combustion tests on the 
kick motor on the locally built second stage solid fuel rocket, making it likely 
that the launch will take place soon. <br>
<br>
The Ministry of Education, Science and Technology announced a January 30 - February 
08 window for launching the Korea Space Launch Vehicle-1 (KSLV-1).<br>
<br>
Now the precise launch date was announced for <b>January 30.</b></font></p>
