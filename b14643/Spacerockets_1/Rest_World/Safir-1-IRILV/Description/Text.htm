    that Iran on the occasion of the anniversary of the revolution had the ambition, 
    to transport a satellite in an orbit. The launch was not shown. But meanewhile 
    there are pictures and video-sequences of a Safir rocket with AIO-logo. The 
    launch has failed evidently.<br>

    system. The named Safir IRILV (Islamic Republic of Iran Launch Vehicle) is standing 
    on the Space Industries Group Center in Tehran. In the meantime there are pictures 
    of the rocket from the transport to the launch site.<br>
    The surprise was great however. The two-stage rocket is composed of a stretched<b>

    as first stage and a shorter second stage of equal diameter. <br>
    The second stage is a liquid propellant stage, which is propelled by two small 
    engines with nozzle extension. The engines are similar a small Soviet Vernier 
    engine. The partially application of the Soviet <b>

    is similar to the Soviet R-27 Vernier turbopump.<br>
    It is said that the Safir IRILV has a length of about 23 meters and weighs 26 
    tons. The diameter is 1.25 m.<br>

    About the result of the launch no information are known up to now. Probable 
    was also the second attempt not successful to shoot a satellite in an earth-orbit.<br>
    From the rocket on the launch-pad some detailed pictures were published for 
    the first time. Even the lift-off of the rocket in the night is in a video documented. 
    In the meantime there is also from the engine of the first stage some pictures. 
    It confirms itself the engine is like Scud-missile engine, only approx. 1.5 
    larger.<br>

    <b>TEHRAN, 2009, Jan. 27</b> -- Iran&#39;s Space Agency (ISA) announced that the 
    first domestically-built satellite of Iran called &quot;Omid&quot; would be sent to the 
    space by March, the semi-official Fars news agency reported. <br>
    &quot;If no problem hinders the process, the Iranian-made satellite will join the 
    orbit by the end of the current Iranian year (ending on March 20),&quot; ISNA President 
    Reza Taqipour said, adding that technical experts are trying to finalize the 
    project according to the schedule, he said but refused to announce the exact 
    day of saying it will be declared near the actual launch.<br>

    <b>TEHRAN, 2009, Feb. 03</b>&nbsp; -- Iran has sent its first home-built satellite 
    into orbit. The Omid lightweight telecommunications satellite was sent into 
    space by the Iranian-produced satellite carrier Safir IRILV, the report said. 
    Equipped with two frequency bands and eight antennae, Omid will transmit information 
    to and from earth while orbiting the planet 15 times an hour, Press TV said. 
    The satellite is also equipped with remote sensing, satellite telemetry and 
    geographic information system technology, as well as remote and ground station 
    data processing.<br>
    The first Iranian satellite was launched into orbit on a southeastern trajectory. 
    Two objects are in orbits of 245 - 378 km; 55.51 deg and 245 - 439 km; 55.6 
    deg. One is presumably the Omid payload and the other the Safir rocket final 
    stage, but it&#39;s not clear yet which is which. The Iranian News Agency calls 
    the launch vehicle Safir-2. Pictures of the launch show &quot;Safir - Omid (2) IRILV&quot; 
    painted on the side of the rocket. However is it probably the third launch. 
    The first vehicle HUS.0001 was launched under another logo.</font></p>
