<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" color="#000080">The National 
Space and Aeronautics Institute (LAPAN) plans to launch its RX-420 rocket for the 
first time on July 2. RX-420 rocket fabrication took three months only, with specification 
as follows: 420 mm diameter, 1,000 kg launching load, 6,200 mm long, fuel solid, 
13 sec combustion time, 205 sec departure time, 4.5 mach maximum speed, 101 km predicted 
cruise distance range, 53 km predicted vertical distance and with load: diagnostic 
tool, GPS, altitude-meter, gyro, 3-axis accelerometer, processor and battery.<br>
The RX-420 rocket is the forerunner to Indonesia&#39;s next indigenous orbital satellite 
launching vehicle program. The announcement was made by Research and Technology 
Minister Kusmayanto Kadiman in Jakarta. During a meeting with Commission VII of 
the House of Representatives, Kadiman said the launch of the RX-420 rocket, with 
a range of 100 km, will be conducted by LAPAN, which had successfully launched a 
RX-320 rocket in 2008. He added that the RX-420 rocket possessed more power than 
the RX-320 and its range could be increased to 190 km if the rocket&#39;s weight was 
reduced. Apart from the scheduled launch in July, there are plans to carry out further 
test launches in 2010 and 2011. In 2014, LAPAN will have finished all its experimental 
rocket launches and will have already developed a rocket with a range of 300 km 
and speed of 7.8 km/sec allowing it to carry a small satellite into space, he said, 
adding that this would be a “monumental achievement.”</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" color="#000080">LAPAN 
that already 45 years on November 27, since 2007 had boosted rocket and satellite 
study and development, especially after got ability to produce solid rocket fuel.<br>
In 2007, RX-250 (250 mm) had been launched successfully with distance 53 km. After 
good result on static test, RX-320 rocket has successfully launched in Pameungpek, 
West Java on May 19, 2008 by transmitting navigation system data, aerodynamics performance, 
trajectory, environment condition and any obstruction during launching. The special 
improvement from this test was RX-320 rocket used Indonesian own solid propellant. 
RX-320 rocket has dimension 320 mm diameter x 4,736 mm long and weight 532 kg. The 
trust power is 52 ton and reached 42 km as per design.<br>
After successfully launched that experimental rocket with diameter 320 mm or coded 
RX-320, LAPAN again succeeded static test RX-420 on 23/12/2008 at LAPAN Aerospace 
Technology Center, Tarogong, Tangerang. In 2009, Chief of LAPAN Adi Sadewo Salatun 
said after successful static test of RX-420, rocket launching program will be continued 
in 2009.<br>
<br>
This RX-420 rocket is the main part of the first LAPAN satellite orbital launching 
vehicle (RPS) that scheduled in 2014, said by Yus Kadarusman Markis, chief of LAPAN 
Aerospace Technology Center. The RPS consists of three-stage rockets, which is in 
the first stage will be three RX-420 as booster, in second stage one RX-420 as sustainer 
and the last is RX-320. With that configuration and LAPAN solid fuel, the SLV-1 
has capability to launch nano satellite to the orbit.<br>
One RX-420 rocket is designed to have distance range about 120 km. With RPS configuration, 
it may reach a vertical height up to 400 km. This rocket can be loaded 5 kg load 
to be able to the orbit minimum 250 km high and at horizontal speed at 8 km/sec.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" color="#000080">For the 
next development, LAPAN will develop rockets with bigger diameter, such as RX-750, 
and liquid fuel that has better performance than solid fuel. RX-420 is the sixth 
rocket developed by Lapan after 70, 100, 150, 250, and 320 mm.</font></p>

LAPAN rockets are classified &quot;RX&quot; (Roket Eksperimental) followed by the diameter 
in millimeters. LAPAN&#39;s current workhouse rocket propulsion system consists of four 
stages, namely the three-stage RX 420 and the RX-320 level. It is planned to use 
the RX-420 as a booster (rocket booster) RPS for the planned Roket Pengorbit Satelit 
(&quot;Orbital Satellite Rocket&quot;) planned to fly in 2014. </font>

    2014, August 22</b> - Tests of the rockets <b>RX-450 and RX-320</b> in Pameungpeuk, 
    Garut, West Java, were successful. Both types are now qualified by the seemingly 
    insurmountable difficulties with the RX-550 for the satellite program. <br>
    As a result of the static test the new RX-450 will burning 18 sec. In the static 
    test, even a burn time of 19.5 seconds was achieved. <br>
    The RX-450 (diameter of 450 mm) has a total length of 6110 mm, and provides 
    a thrust of 12,895 kg (126.45 kN). The housing for the rocket propellant has 
    a length of 4459 mm. After the first succesful test, the RX-450 is ready for 
    flight tests end of 2014. <br>
    <br>
    The flight test of the RX-320 which is already previously been developed has 
    met the expectations. With a launch angle of 70 ° was reached a flight altitude 
    of 20-30 miles. <br>
    The combination RX-450 and RX-320 is indeed suitable only for atmospheric soundings, 
    but should be a new perspective for the development of the launch vehicle <b>RPS-01</b></font>.</font></td>
