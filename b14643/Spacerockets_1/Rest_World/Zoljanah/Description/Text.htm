</font>2020, Aug. -- </b>Defense Minister Hatami says *solid fuel* SLV Zoljanah 
is of the &quot;same size and shape&quot; as Simorgh SLV. Zoljanah can be launched from a 
mobile launch platform. Hatami mentioned that he thinks there will be a launch of 
the Zoljanah SLV in the current Iranian year (until March 2021).<br>
<u>Note</u>: What mean &quot;same size and shape&quot; ?. It is puzzling. It cannot refer 
to the diameter.</p>

aboard a new, *solid fuel* SLV called <b>Zoljanah</b>. The launch will reportedly 
take place around summer 2020, and will send the satellite to ~250 km orbit.</p>
