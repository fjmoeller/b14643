    text of the English-language report on North Korea&#39;s KCNA news agency saying 
    the DPRK <u>had successfully put a satellite into orbit</u>:<br>
    &quot;Scientists and technicians of the DPRK (North Korea) have succeeded in putting 
    satellite Kwangmyongsong-2, an experimental communications satellite, into orbit 
    by means of carrier rocket Unha-2 under the state&#39;s long-term plan for the development 
    of outer space. Unha-2, which was launched at the Tonghae Satellite Launching 
    Facility in Hwadae County, North Hamgyong Province at 11:20 (02:20 GMT) on April 
    5, accurately put Kwangmyongsong-2 into its orbit at 11:29:02, <u>nine minutes 
    and two seconds after its launch</u>. The satellite is going round the earth 
    along its elliptic orbit at the angle of inclination of 40.6 degrees at 490 
    km perigee and 1,426 km apogee. Its cycle is 104 minutes and 12 seconds. Mounted 
    on the satellite are necessary measuring devices and communications apparatuses. 
    The satellite is going round on its routine orbit. It is sending to the earth 
    the melodies of the immortal revolutionary paeans &#39;Song of General Kim Il-sung&#39; 
    and &#39;Song of General Kim Jong-il&#39; and measured information at 470 MHz. By the 
    use of the satellite the relay communications is now underway by UHF frequency 
    band. The satellite is of decisive significance in promoting the scientific 
    researches into the peaceful use of outer space and solving scientific and technological 
    problems for the launch of practical satellites in the future. Carrier rocket 
    Unha-2 has three stages. The carrier rocket and the satellite developed by the 
    indigenous wisdom and technology are the shining results gained in the efforts 
    to develop the nation&#39;s space science and technology on a higher level….&quot;<br>

    Republic of Korea has reconfirmed that its satellite launch in early April was 
    successful, the official news agency KCNA said.<br>
    The Kwangmyongsong-2 satellite was accurately put into orbit and has sent back

    <font size="2" color="#000080"><b>The design of the impressive launch vehicle</b> 
    &quot;Unha-2&quot; is a great surprise. Time before, I have believed that the first stage 
    could be the reproduction of a
    <a target="_blank" href="../../../../Spacerockets/Specials/DF-3/index.htm">
    <b>Chinese DF-3</b> <b>missile</b></a>. That is not confirmed now. China is 
    not involved. The first stage of the &quot;Unha-2&quot; is clearly a brand-new rocket. 
    The propulsion is a cluster of four Nodong engines. All four fixed Nodong engines 
    of cluster use its own turbopumps with their typical exhaust tubes. The turbopump 
    exhaust tubes are inside of the airframe. Length, diameter and masses of the 
    stage correspond <u>not</u> with the Chinese DF-3 missile (what I previously 
    believed). The diameter of 2.40 m is larger as at the Chinese DF-3 !<br>
    <br>
    The second stage is for the attentive analyst not a surprise, since the Iranian 
    Safir IRILV is known. The second stage of the Safir IRILV is only a down-scaled 
    variant (probably used for the unknown North Korean Paektusan-2). The new North 
    Korean larger dimensioned second stage (diameter 1.50 m) probably is propelled 
    by <u><b>
    <a target="_blank" href="../../../../Spacerockets/Specials/Unha-second-stage/index.htm">
    new small engines</a></b></u> with higher thrust. This engine is an unknown 
    Soviet engine (ripple structure on the nozzle is typical for an <b>Isayev design</b>).<br>
    <br>
    The third stage appears to be a solid fuel motor. The motor is within the large 
    lower part of the payload fairing. The Unha-2 rocket is total approximately 
    29.5 m long.<br>
    The first stage of the rocket used with high probability a fuel combination
    <b>UDHM/AK-27</b>. The second stage&nbsp; used with high probability a fuel 
    combination <b>UDHM/N2O4. </b>The tank volume ratio O/F is about 1.6.</font></p>
