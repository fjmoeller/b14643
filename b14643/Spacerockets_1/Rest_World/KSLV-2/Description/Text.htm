<p align="left"><font color="#000080">The Korea Space Launch Vehicle (</font><b><font color="#FF0000">KSLV-2</font></b><font color="#000080">) 
is a 3-stage launch vehicle consisting of 1st stage with 4 clustered 75-ton liquid 
rocket engines, 2nd stage with a 75-ton liquid rocket engine and 3rd stage with 
a 7-ton liquid rocket engine under parallel development.<br>
The Korea Space Launch Vehicle (KSLV-2) program consists of 3 continuous phases.<br>
<b>Phase 1</b> (Mar. 2010~Jul. 2015) activities include reviews of preliminary and 
system designs, construction of propulsion test facilities and ground test of 7-ton 
liquid rocket engine, which are successfully accomplished. <br>
During the <b>Phase 2</b> (Aug. 2015-Mar. 2018), currently underway, the detailed 
design of engine and the launch vehicle, ground test of 75-ton liquid rocket engine 
and launch of </font><font color="#FF0000">Test Launch Vehicle</font><font color="#000080"> 
(for the verification 75-ton and 7-ton LRE performance) will be completed. The test 
vehicle that has one 75-ton and one 7-ton engines is scheduled to be launched in 
December 2017.<br>
The final <b>Phase 3</b> (Apr. 2018-Mar. 2021) aims the completion of the 3-stage 
launch vehicle system development effort, which will be followed by two trial launches 
to confirm the successful program accomplishment.<br>
The rocket engine is the core element of launch vehicle technology. The development 
of a 75- ton-class liquid rocket engine and a 7-ton-class liquid rocket engine is 
the key agenda of the Korea Space Launch Vehicle (KSLV-2) program.<br>
The 75-ton-class and 7-ton-class liquid engines to be mounted on Korea Space Launch 
Vehicle (KSLV-2) will be developed to the gas generator-turbo-pump type which will 
use kerosene as fuel and oxygen as oxidizer. For the development of rocket engine 
for the Korea Space Launch Vehicle (KSLV-2), 10 different propulsion (engine) test 
facilities (including Combustion Chamber Test Facility, Turbo-pump Test Facility, 
Rocket Engine Test Facility, Altitude Engnie Faciltiy, Propulsion System Test Facility 
in Naro Space Center) have been constructed in various locations. These facilities 
enabled the large-scale/high-thrust engine tests which were previously impossible 
in Korea.<br>
These test facilities enable step-by-step tests of component performance tests for 
combustion chamber, turbo-pump and gas generators, which are key components of the 
75-ton and 7-ton engines, and performance tests of integrated engines in ground 
and high altitude conditions. <br>
The plan is to conduct tests (each requires around one week of preparation/test/analysis) 
on each component and engine anywhere between several dozens and 200 times.</font></p>

second launch of the KSLV-2 (Nuri) with the satellite PVSAT (180 kg) and other payloads 
was successful. Thew planned SSO orbit has been achieved.</font><b><font color="#FF0000"><br>
</font><br>
2021, October 21</b></font><font size="2"> -- The KSLV-2 (Nuri) with a dummy satellite 
on board has completed an unsuccessful maiden flight. The required final speed was 
not achieved because the third stage did not have the planned power. After a reduced 
burning time of about 475 sec, the final speed was 6.5 km/sec.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>2018, Dec. 06 </b>-- A new engine is being developed 
to enhance performance. It is a gas generator (!) engine used in the upper stage 
of future Korean launch vehicle.<br>
A video is showing the test of the 9 t thrust engine. Burn time was 100 seconds, 
which was success.<b><br>
<br>
2018, Nov. 28 -- The TLV was successfully tested in flight. After 151 sec of burn-time, 
a altitude of 209 km was reached.</b></font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>2018, Febr. 06 -- </b>The South Korean government 
postponed the launch of the KSLV-2 from December 2019 to February 2021. Still, it 
is going to launch a test vehicle (TLV). The test vehicle will be launched in October 
this year to this end and re-launched in October next year if the project fails.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>2016, July 01</b> -- Korea has decided to postpone 
the test-launch of its next-generation space rocket, scheduled for late next year, 
due to some technical glitches.<br>
The government had planned to complete the development of a two-stage test rocket 
by 2017 as part of a long-term project to produce an indigenous three-stage KSLV-2 
rocket.<br>
The Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) said it will have to delay the test-launch 
for about 10 months. It cited a problem in the combustion of a 75-ton engine and 
more trouble in the welding of a fuel tank.</font></p>
