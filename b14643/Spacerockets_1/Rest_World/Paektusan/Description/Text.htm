<font size="2" color="#000080">Two North Korean rockets were given the US names
<i>Taepo-Dong 1</i> and <i>Taepo-Dong 2</i> as the nearest map reference was called 
Taepo-Dong. The first of these, Taepo-Dong 1, use as first stage a Nodong&nbsp; 
missile and a Soviet Scud-D as second stage.<br>
<br>
The first launch of the <b>Taepo-Dong 1</b> (now </font><b>
<font size="2" color="#FF0000">Paektusan</font></b><font size="2" color="#000080">) 
was made in August 1998, although this test used a three stage missile with an additional 
solid-propellant third stage added. The launch was made from the test facility near 
Musudan-ri and it is reported that the third stage flew for around 4,000 km. The 
launch site had a single open mesh square launch platform. Preparations were reported 
for a second launch in November 1998, but no further flights have been made.<br>
North Korea described the launch in 1998 as a satellite launch vehicle test, stating 
that the third stage placed a small satellite into an elliptical orbit. US and other 
reports suggested that the satellite did not go into orbit as the third stage failed 
during motor burn.</font></p>

<font size="2" color="#000080"><b>North Korea reported</b> the launch of its first 
satellite. This announcement was followed on September 14, 1998 by the release of 
a photograph of the satellite and the claim that the satellite had completed its 
100th orbit of the earth. Video of the launch, the satellite, and an animation of 
the satellite in orbit around the earth were distributed to foreign news agencies 
the following weekend.<br>
Despite these claims no foreign observer ever detected the satellite visually, by 
radar, or picked up its radio signals. What seems to have happened is that the third 
stage either failed and fell into the Pacific or misfired and put the satellite 
into a low orbit where it decayed very quickly before it could be detected by foreign 
observers. <br>
<br>
<b>North Korea reported the launch of its first satellite as follows: </b><br>
&quot;Our scientists and technicians have succeeded in launching the first artificial 
satellite aboard a multi-stage rocket into orbit. The rocket was launched in the 
direction of 86 degrees at a launching station in Musudan-ri (40.8 deg N, 129.7 
deg E) at 12:07 August 31, 1998 and correctly put the satellite into orbit at 12 
hours 11 minutes 53 seconds in four minutes 53 seconds. &quot;<br>
&quot;The rocket is of three stages. The first stage was separated from the rocket 95 
seconds after the launch and fell on the open waters of the East Sea of Korea 253 
km off the launching station, that is 40 degrees 51 minutes north latitude 139 degrees 
40 minutes east longitude. The second stage opened the capsule in 144 seconds, separated 
itself from the rocket in 266 seconds and fell on the open waters of the Pacific 
1,646 km off from the launching station, that is 40 degrees 13 minutes north latitude 
149 degrees 07 minutes east longitude. The third stage put the satellite into orbit 
27 seconds after the separation of the second stage. &quot;<br>
&quot;The satellite is running along the oval orbit 218.8 km in the nearest distance 
from the earth and 6,978.2 km in the farthest distance. Its period is 165 minutes 
6 seconds. The satellite is equipped with necessary sounding instruments. The satellite 
is now transmitting the melody of the revolutionary hymns in 27 MHz.&quot;</font></p>
