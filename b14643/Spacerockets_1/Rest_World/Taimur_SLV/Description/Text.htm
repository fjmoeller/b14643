    <td width="65%"><font size="2" color="#000080">Pakistan began developed its 
    first SLV in 1998. On March 2001, Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan announced that Pakistani 
    scientists were in the process of building the country&#39;s first Satellite Launch 
    Vehicle (SLV) and that the project had been assigned to SUPARCO.<br>
    <br>
    Dr. Abdul Majid, then-chairman of SUPARCO, confirmed Dr. Khan&#39;s statement and 
    said &quot; Pakistan envision a low-cost SLV and Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) 
    in order to launch light-weight satellite into low-earth orbits. Dr. Abdul Qadeer 
    Khan also added that&quot; Pakistan has very robust IRBMs which can launch geostationary 
    orbiting satellites.<br>
    During the <b>IDEAS 2002</b> defense exhibition Pakdef spotted two similar models 
    of Pakistani Satellite Launch Vehicles.<br>
    <br>
    The first model points out a possible three stage of Satellite Launch Vehicle 
    (SLV). Judging from other similar SLV&#39;s, it is estimated that it can place a 
    payload weighing around 80-100 kilogram to an orbit 450-490 kilometers above 
    Earth&#39;s surface. However the exact data remains unknown. <br>
    The second model of the SLV seems similar to the first model however, with four 
    extra boosters ( ? Abdali).<br>

    were the first test flights of the two stage solid-fuel Shaheen-2. The Shaheen-2

    It is reported that the Shaheen 1 and 2 missiles have been developed by the 
    Pakistan National Defence Complex (PNDC) with assistance from SUPARCO, the Pakistan 
    space research organisation, and from the Atomic Energy Commission. <br>

    The Shaheen-2 uses like the M-18, two aerospace solid rocket motors developed 
    by China Hexi Chemical &amp; Mechanical Company. A relevant motor for the first 
    stage is the <b>
