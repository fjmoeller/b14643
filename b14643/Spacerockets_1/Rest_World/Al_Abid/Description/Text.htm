    was a project to design and manufacture a space launcher capable of putting 
    a satellite into orbit and was an entirely civilian project. The project commenced 
    in 1988. The programme’s declared name was Al Abid. The project was carried 
    out under the auspices of MIMI and involved scientists from Iraq’s Space Research 
    Centre, who had built a 50 kg test satellite and engineers from Project 144, 
    primarily Project 144/2, to develop a launch vehicle.<br>
    Their task was to prepare independent studies for a space launcher capable of 
    delivering a 100-300 kg payload to a low earth orbit (about 200-500 km altitude). 
    The delivery system had to be produced using assets already existing in Iraq, 
    mainly Scud, versions of indigenously modified Scud and SA-2 liquid propellant 
    missiles.<br>
    A number of design configurations were studied by SRC. Among the initial design 
    options studied were configurations based on 4, 5 or 6 extended burn-time <b>
    <a target="_blank" href="../../../../Spacerockets/Specials/Scud/index.htm">Scud</a></b> rockets 
    as a first stage clustered around another extended burn-time Scud as second 
    stage, with a specially designed solid propellant rocket as the third stage.<br>
    Another study focused on various configurations using 5 or 7 Scud-based rockets 
    as a first stage, separated from a second stage modified Scud rocket by an inter-stage 
    mechanism, and a specially designed rocket for the third stage. By early 1989, 
    the SRC proposals had apparently converged on a design comprising 5 clustered 
    modified Scud&#39;s for the first stage; another modified Scud for the second stage 
    and a double-base propellant rocket for third stage.<br>
    The other team of two foreign specialists provided the results of their studies 
    in two reports in February 1989. Their studies were based on design configurations 
    comprising a modified Scud rocket with strap-on rockets of either four or eight 
    SA-2 liquid propellant rockets or four or eight Scud rockets. Both a liquid 
    propellant and a solid propellant second stage were considered and a representative 
    apogee motor was used for their parametric calculations.<br>
    The basic vehicle design configuration chosen by the Iraqis by mid-1989 consisted 
    of five clustered, extended burn Scud engines for the first stage and a 1250mm 
    diameter liquid propellant rocket for the second stage. It is unclear if details 
    of the third stage rocket had been determined at that time, although some evidence 
    points to use of another modified Scud. The major effort at the time was on 
    the first and second stages.<br>
    The first test launch of the Al Abid occurred in December 1989 at the fixed 
    launch site that had been constructed at Al Anbar. However, only the first stage 
    of the vehicle tested was operational, while stages two and three were steel 
    mockups. A videotape of the test showed that the first stage of five clustered 
    Scud missiles was working successfully until the vehicle exploded at 45 seconds. 
    Iraq suspected that the explosive bolts that were being used to effect stage 
    separation functioned prematurely.<br>
    While primary concentration in the initial flight test was on validating the 
    first stage, work for the second and third stages had also commenced. In the 
    initial design studies undertaken by SRC, the second stage was to be a Scud 
    with an extended burn-time but with the standard airframe diameter of 880mm. 
    However, by the beginning of 1989 the diameter of the second stage had been 
    increased to 1250mm.<br>
    The main problem that Iraq had with the second stage was that a standard Scud 
    liquid propellant engine produced only sufficient impulse to achieve their minimum 
    requirements. SRC had highlighted through its early parametric studies that 
    orbital capability, that is, heavier payload or higher orbit, was markedly more 
    sensitive to changes in second stage performance than to changes in the first 
    stage performance.<br>
    They proposed that the performance of the second stage rocket engine could be 
    improved, firstly, by increasing the expansion ratio of the engine nozzle from 
    10 to 30 by addition of a nozzle skirt and, secondly, by </span></font>
    <span lang="en-gb"><font size="2" color="#000080">changing the fuel to diethylenetriamine 
    (DETA) or a mixture of DETA and unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine (UDMH).<br>
    <br>
    Iraq focused on improving the Scud engine. Project 1728 was conducting work 
    in parallel with the work done by Project 144/2, looking to improve the performance 
    of Al Abid second stage engine. A test was carried out on 1 Dec 1990 by Project 
    1728 that used a nozzle extension for increased expansion ratio and UDMH as 
    fuel for higher energy. However, without any cooling to emulate a high altitude 
    condition the skirt melted and the test failed after 14 seconds.</font></span></p>

    Iraq declared that they came up with the idea to use a new engine with four 
    Scud combustion chambers and a single turbo-pump for the Al Abid first stage. 
    The new engine would fit the 1250mm airframe, and using a mixture of DETA and 
    UDMH fuel would provide an alternative to the cluster of five Scud missiles.</font></span></p>

    Iraqi bird: Beyond Saddam’s space program<br>
    by Dwayne A. Day<br>

    <font size="2"><br>
    &quot;During the 1980s the government of Saddam Hussein sought to develop an indigenous 
    space program.<br>
    Until recently, the details of this effort have been obscure and unknown to 
    the world. A few years ago a United Nations arms control report revealed some 
    information on Iraqi efforts in the late 1980s to develop a rocket capable of 
    launching a satellite.<br>
    Now, new details have emerged about Iraqi efforts in the period 1988–1991 to 
    develop small satellites to fly atop those rockets.<br>
    <br>
    The details of the Iraqi satellite effort are contained in a presentation made 
    by one of the former scientists involved in the program at a recent small satellite 
    conference. According to Sarmad D.S. Dawood of the Space Applications Center 
    of the Space Technology Directorate within Iraq’s Ministry of Science &amp; Technology 
    in Baghdad, from 1988 until 1990 Iraq’s Scientific Research Council established 
    a research center to develop space technology.<br>
    The research center started the Al-Ta’ir project. Al-Ta’ir was a small experimental 
    satellite for conducting communications and ranging experiments.<br>
    <br>
    Dawood stated that the research center built two identical flight ready satellites. 
    Surprisingly, the satellites still exist and are in storage at the Ministry 
    of Science &amp; Technology in Baghdad. <br>
    <br>
    The satellite was an octagon with a height of 47 centimeters, a diameter of 
    74 centimeters, and a mass of 75 kilograms. <br>
    <br>
    What remains unclear is if the Al-Ta’ir satellite was also intended for launch 
    aboard Iraq’s indigenous satellite launching vehicle, the Al Abid. On December 
    5, 1989, Iraq launched a 25-meter long rocket from a launch pad 230 kilometers 
    southwest of Baghdad. This was a test of the first stage of the Al Abid and 
    the second and third stages were only mockups.<br>
    Iraqi engineers chose to develop a clustered rocket design. The third stage 
    diameter was 1.25 meters, more than sufficient to carry the 0.74-meter diameter 
    Al-Ta’ir satellite.<br>
    After the December 1989 test Iraqi engineers decided to test the Al Abid’s second 
    and third stages separately and planned further tests for the fall of 1990. 
    According to Dawood, from 1991 to 2003, Iraq continued designing subsystems 
    for more advanced satellite missions such as remote sensing spacecraft. The 
    country’s engineers conducted simulation and modeling of subsystems, including 
    digital imaging cameras. That work halted after the 2003 American invasion of 
    Iraq.&quot;</font></p>
