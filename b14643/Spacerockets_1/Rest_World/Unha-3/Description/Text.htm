    DPRK National Aerospace Development Administration issued a report on the successful 
    launch of earth observation satellite Kwangmyongsong-4. The Carrier rocket Kwangmyongsong 
    blasted off from the Sohae Space Center. The satellite entered its preset orbit 
    at 9 minutes and 46 seconds after the lift-off. The satellite is going round 
    the polar orbit at 494.6 km perigee altitude and 500 km apogee altitude at the 
    angle of inclination of 97.4 degrees. <br>

    a new North Korean rocket launch appear to be underway at the Sohae Satellite 
    Launching Station. Based on DigitalGlobe satellite imagery released on November 
    23 and 26, trailers carrying the first two stages of an Unha rocket were spotted 
    parked near the main missile assembly building, a clear indicator that the rocket 
    stages are being checked out before moving to the pad for an eventual launch.<br>
    Other launch-related activities are ongoing. Empty tanks spotted at four locations 
    indicate that the propellant buildings at the pad have likely been filled in 
    preparation for the fueling of the rocket. The instrumentation site for monitoring 
    a launch is still incomplete - one temporary building with a possible antenna 
    has been established at the site, but instrumentation trailers are still parked 
    near the assembly building.<br>

    <b>2012, Dec. 01</b> -- North Korea announced that it would attempt to launch 
    a Unha-3 #2 rocket in mid-December.<br>
    In a statement carried by the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA), the Korean 
    Committee for Space Technology said the new bid would be carried out between 
    December 10 and 22.<br>
    A spokesman for North Korea&#39;s Korean Committee for Space Technology said scientists 
    have &quot;analyzed the mistakes&quot; made in the failed April launch and improved the 
    precision of its Unha rocket and Kwangmyongsong satellite, according to the 
    official Korean Central News Agency.<br>

    North Korea says it is considering postponing a planned launch originally set 
    for between December 10 and 22, citing unspecified problems during preparations.<br>
    The Korean Committee for Space Technology said its scientists and engineers 
    were &quot;considering seriously the possibility of readjusting the launch period&quot;.<br>
    &quot;We are now in the final stage of preparations for the launch&quot;, it said in a 
    statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency.<br>
    &quot;But in the course of the preparations, some problems have arisen, compelling 
    our scientists and engineers to consider seriously the possibility of readjusting 
    the launch period.&quot;<br>

    <b>2012, Dec. 10 </b>-- A day after announcing a review of the original December 
    10-22 launch schedule, the Korean Committee of Space Technology said it was 
    extending the window to December 29.<br>
    In a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency, the committee 
    said scientists and technicians were still &quot;pushing forward&quot; with preparations 
    for the mission.<br>
    &quot;They, however,<b> found a technical deficiency in the first-stage control engine 
    module</b> of the rocket... and decided to extend the launch period,&quot; it said.</font><font color="#800080" size="2"><br>

    John McDowell told <i>The New York Times</i> that the satellite ended up in 
    the right orbit. But the preponderance of the evidence suggests that the satellite 
    failed either during the ascent or shortly afterwards. As scientists had not 
    picked up any transmissions from the North Korean satellite, McDowell said, 
    and it is believed the device is <b>tumbling in an uncontrolled orbit</b>, spinning 
    end over end, indicating that it is not responding to commands from its minders.</font></p>
