    <td width="65%"><font size="2" color="#000080">Pakistan began developed its 
    first SLV in 1998. On March 2001, Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan announced that Pakistani 
    scientists were in the process of building the country&#39;s first Satellite Launch 
    Vehicle (SLV) and that the project had been assigned to SUPARCO.<br>
    <br>
    Dr. Abdul Majid, then-chairman of SUPARCO, confirmed Dr. Khan&#39;s statement and 
    said &quot; Pakistan envision a low-cost SLV and Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) 
    in order to launch light-weight satellite into low-earth orbits. Dr. Abdul Qadeer 
    Khan also added that&quot; Pakistan has very robust IRBMs which can launch geostationary 
    orbiting satellites.<br>
    During the <b>IDEAS 2002</b> defense exhibition Pakdef spotted two similar models 
    of Pakistani Satellite Launch Vehicles.<br>
    <br>
    The first model points out a possible three stage of Satellite Launch Vehicle 
    (SLV). Judging from other similar SLV&#39;s, it is estimated that it can place a 
    payload weighing around 80-100 kilogram to an orbit 450-490 kilometers above 
    Earth&#39;s surface. However the exact data remains unknown. <br>
    The second model of the SLV seems similar to the first model however, with four 
    extra boosters ( ? Abdali).<br>

    Pakistan successfully test-fired in four times a&nbsp; </font>

    surface-to-surface ballistic missile. It has a range of 2,700 kilometres. It 
    were the first test flights of the two stage solid-fuel Shaheen-2. The Shaheen-2 
    is the longest-range missile tested by Pakistan so far. Shaheen-2</font><font size="2" color="#FF0000">
    </font><font size="2" color="#000080">is not an advanced version of&nbsp; Shaheen-1, 
    which has a range of&nbsp; 700 kilometres.<br>
    <br>
    It is reported that the Shaheen 1 and 2 missiles have been developed by the 
    Pakistan National Defence Complex (PNDC) with assistance from SUPARCO, the Pakistan 
    space research organisation, and from the Atomic Energy Commission. <br>
    <br>
    The Shaheen-1 (Hatf-4)&nbsp; is probably a copy of&nbsp; China&#39;s <b>

    M-18</a></b></u>.<br>
    The Shaheen-2 uses like the M-18, two aerospace solid rocket motors developed 
    by China Hexi Chemical &amp; Mechanical Company. A relevant motor for the first 
    stage is the <b>

    Meanwhile, a new Shaheen-III successfully tested in 2015. It is an improved 
    Shaheen-2 with an about 1.7 m stretched first stage. Thus also an increased 
    performance of a satellite-launcher would be possible.</font></td>

<p align="left"><font color="#800080"><b>2017, January 24</b> -- Pakistan has reported 
the test-launch of a new missile called &quot;Ababeel&quot;. The published images documented 
that is a Shaheen-III missile, on which was added a solid third stage. A fourth 
stage (space tug) is likely.<br>
&nbsp;As a result, Pakistan now has a SLV for the transport of orbital payloads. 
The Ababeel (Taimoor) is very similar to the Chinese <b>

It is composed of a Shaheen-III with the two upper stages of the KZ-1A. The performance
