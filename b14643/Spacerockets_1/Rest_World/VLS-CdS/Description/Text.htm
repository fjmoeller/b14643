    <td width="77%"><font color="#000080" size="2">On October 24, 2005, the Brazilian 
    government unveiled its ambitious &quot;Cruzeiro do Sul&quot; space-rockets program, which 
    will be jointly conducted by the CTA and AEB in partnership with the Russians 
    and will include the development of five new launchers until 2022. The partnership 
    with the Russians begins by the technical review of the VLS-alfa project and 
    consulting services in engineering. Meetings between scientists of the AEB, 
    the Russian agency RFSA - Russian Federal Space Agency, and INPE, besides representatives 
    of the Air Force Command and business sector, serve to discuss the joint work 
    under the supervision of technicians from the Russian space agency. The main 
    contractor is probably State Rocket Center “Makeyev” Design Bureau.<u><br>
    <br>
    Characteristics of the future Brazilian rocket family, according to CTA:<br>
    </u><br>
    <b>VLS Alfa</b>: Initial vehicle of the family. The VLS-1 will be changed by 
    a new liquid propellant upper stage with KBKhA engine </font>

    This configuration will have a capacity of 250 kg to place satellites in a 750 
    km equatorial orbit.<br>
    <b>VLS Beta</b>: This configuration is composed of a larger new first stage, 
    contain solid propellant, and two liquid propellant upper stages. The performance 
    of this vehicle will allow the launch of satellites of up to 800 kg in equatorial 
    orbit.<br>
    <b>VLS Gama</b>: It is the first vehicle of the Southern Cross Program. Liquid 
    propellant is contains in all stages. The first stage is propelled by a Russian<br>

    engine. The launcher will have capacity to place satellites in polar orbits 
    and geostationary transfer orbits.<br>
    <b>VLS Delta</b>: Using two solid propellant boosters, the VLS Delta have an 
    upgraded capacity to its predecessor (VLS Gama). The transport of satellites 
    of up to 2 tons in a geostationary transfer orbit is possible.<br>
    <b>VLS Epsilon</b>: It is the final launcher configuration of the Southern Cross 
    Program, with a capacity to transport satellites up to 4 tons in a geostationary 
    transfer orbit. The launcher consist of three liquid propellant main stages 
    and two liquid propellant booster stages. Some launchers are related to the 
    former OrionSpace Launch System Project</font><font size="2" color="#FF0000">***</font><font color="#000080" size="2">.<br>

    The test launch of the VLS-Alfa rocket is scheduled for 2012 and the first launch 
    of the fully loaded rocket is due in 2013.</font><p ALIGN="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">

    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">New</span></b>: Brazil has come out 
    with a <b>new strategic plan</b> to guide its space efforts through 2021 that 
    involves a significant change in its effort to develop a domestic satellite 
    launch industry.<br>
    Brazil has scaled back an ambitious Southern Cross development program to focus 
    on a series of smaller launch vehicles that appear to rely more on home-grown 
    technology. <br>
    The other notable change in the plan is that Brazil and Germany are jointly 
    working on a micro-satellite launcher (VLM Nova) that would be capable of lifting 
    payloads weighing 150 kg into a 300-kilometer orbit. <br>
    Meanwhile, Brazil is continuing work on launching Ukraine’s Cyclone-4 rocket 
    from the Alcantara Launch Center in 2014.<br>
    This is a significant change from Brazil’s previous plan, which featured close 
    co-operation with Russia to develop a new family of boosters under the Southern 
    Cross program. The series would have incorporated technologies from Russia.<br>
    The rockets in the Southern Cross program were named:<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="1" color="#000080">Alfa (light)<br>
    Beta (light)<br>

    Epsilon (heavy) – 4 tons to GTO.</font><font size="2" color="#800080"><br>
