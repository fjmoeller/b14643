      <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0"><font color="#000080" size="2">The current 
      Brazilian Satellite Launcher Vehicle (VLS-1) cannot meet the overall strategic 
      objectives of the space sector. However, it is envisaged the possibility to 
      significantly increase the payload capacity of VLS-1 through partial modification 
      of the vehicle, especially with the replacement of the solid propellant motors 
      by liquid propellant engines in an upper stage.<br>
      To achieve this goal, several activities have been conducted in Instituto 
      de Aeronáutica e Espaço (IAE) such as the specification, design and construction 
      of liquid rocket engines. One of these<br>
      projects is the L-75 engine.<br>
      In 2011, a protocol of intention between Brazilian Space Agency (AEB) and 
      the </font><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><u>German Aerospace Center (Deutsches 
      Zentrum für Luft-und Raumfahrt - DLR)</u></font><font color="#000080" size="2"><b>
      </b>was established with the objective of fostering cooperation in space activities. 
      After a visit of a German delegation at IAE in April 2011, a letter of exchange 
      was established in October 2012 for further detailing the envisaged activities 
      within the cooperation. The conductance of a review of the L-75 engine was 
      identified as a first major step.<br>
      Starting in 2012, meetings regarding a specific implementation agreement between 
      the IAE and the DLR to the development and tests of a 75 kN Ethanol/LOX were 
      organized.<br>
      For the L-75 engine project, it is imperative to prioritize the development 
      and mastery of critical space technologies, which are essential to the industrial 
      progress, and the achievement of the necessary national autonomy in such a 
      strategic activity.<b><u><br>

      L-75 engine main characteristics</u><br>
      </b>The main high-level function of the L-75 engine is providing (75.0 ± 5.0) 
      kN of nominal thrust in vacuum with the main operation conditions:<br>
      • Specific impulse greater than 2,940 m/s in vacuum;<br>
      • Minimum mission burn time of 400 s;<br>
      • Global mixture ratio in the range of 1.50 to 1.95;<br>
      • Total pressure inside of the combustion chamber in the range of 5 to 7 MPa.<br>
      <br>
      The L-75 engine thrust chamber consists of three main components, the combustion 
      chamber, where the propellants undergo a set of chemical reactions at high 
      pressure creating hot gases during the combustion process; the nozzle, where 
      the hot gases are accelerated to supersonic velocities; and the injector head, 
      where the propellants are introduced, broken up into small liquid droplets 
      and distributed over the cross section of the burning region inside the combustion 
      chamber. The thrust chamber cooling is a major challenge because the gas temperature 
      exceeds the melting point of the metallic wall. To overcome this problem, 
      the L-75 engine uses a lightweight brazed and welded cooling jacket with a 
      thin inner-wall construction.<br>
      The turbopump is one of the most critical components during the development 
      of a LPRE, since it is a high-precision and high-speed rotating machinery 
      operating in critical conditions. The main goal of the turbopump is to feed 
      the thrust chamber and gas generator with the necessary flow and pressure 
      of fuel and oxidizer provided by the pumps, which are driven by the turbine. 
      Its manufacturing is expensive, and its design is complex and demands a great 
      effort of engineering.<br>
      The L-75 engine will operate with a thrust regulator, which is capable to 
      regulate the LOX pressure for the gas generator, modulating the turbine power, 
      which reflects on the turbopump shaft speed and pumps power. It is also equipped 
      with two main valve assemblies, one for LOX and another for ethanol. Both 
      of them are very similar in configuration and their functions cover chilldown/filling 
      bypass, gas purging, pressure safety relief, opening at the start-up sequence 
      and closing at the shutdown sequence.<br>
      The aim of the L-75 ignition system is to achieve a safe, predictable, and 
      reliable transition to nominal thrust in vacuum. The ignition system devices 
      include a turbine starter, gas generator igniter, thrust chamber igniter and 
      pyrotechnic actuators.<br>
      The L-75 engine igniter and the turbine starter are based on the operating 
      principles of solid rocket motors, consisting of a metallic structure, an 
      electro-pyrotechnic starter, a reinforcement cartridge, the main cartridge 
      propellant, and the thermal protection and nozzle.<br>
      The control system of the L-75 engine is responsible for the starting procedure 
      and ensures a safe transition to nominal thrust in vacuum; to achieve the 
      desired thrust by controlling the fuel and oxidizer flow rate and pressure 
      drops; safe shutdown of the firing operation. Furthermore, additionally controlled 
      features are the precision of the automatic thrust control, mixture-ratio 
      control and condition monitoring (safety controls or health monitoring of 
      the engine).</font></p>
