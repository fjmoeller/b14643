He said this engine has <u>higher energetic indexes</u> compared to other second

One of the feature of this engine is creation of high controllablity in second stage

<b><br>
TEHRAN, 2012, March 05</b> -- Information by&nbsp; Mehdi Farahi, Director of the 
Aerospace Industry Organization: Omid satellite was launched by Safir (Safir-1). 
Rasad was launched by <b>Safir-1A</b>. Safir-1A is the same Safir-1 but some improvements 
with around 10% changes.<br>
<b>Safir-1B</b> can lift double payload of Safir-1, with modification of fuel, top 
body, engines of first and second stage, batteries and a series of small changes 
in main rocket.<br>
<b><br>
TEHRAN, 2012, Febr. 14 </b>-- The <b>Safir -1B</b> carrier is capable of launching 
satellites weighing more than 60 kg to 350-450 km in an orbit and has made a huge 
progress comparing to Safir-1A. Engine, fuel, guide and control system of the Safir-1B 
differ from its previous version. The Navid satellite was launched by a Safir-1B.<br>
<u><b><br>
David Wright commented</b></u>: “Iranian press reports said the Safir-1B is a modification 
of the launcher used for its previous satellites but with “20 percent more launch 
power.” However, this claim is doubtful since the orbits of Navid and Omid (246 
km x 381 km x 55.7deg) require essentially the same speed to insert them into their 
orbits (7.79 km/s for Navid vs. 7.81 km/s for Omid), and the increase in payload 
mass from 27 kg (Omid) to 50 kg (Navid) is a tiny fraction of the overall launcher 
mass. The higher altitude for orbit insertion of Navid compared to Omid (275 km 
vs. 246 km) requires only a few percent increase in “launch power,” which could 
be accomplished, for example, by increasing the thrust slightly or reducing the 
body mass of the launcher.&quot;<br>
<br>
<u><b><span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Note</span>:</b></u>&nbsp; Safir-Rasad 
is a <b>Safir-1A</b> type. Safir-1A is like Safir-1 but some design improvements 
with around 10% changes (propellant too ?). Safir-Navid is a <b>Safir-1B</b> type. 
The Safir-1Aand Safir-1B uses no longer the AK-27 but N2O4 Oxidizer. The striking 
brown AK-plume at the nozzle like the Shahab-3 is not more visible. The thrust of 
the first stage is increased to 116%. The Safir-1A and Safir-1B uses smaller fins 
(similar to the Ghadr-I) in compare to the Safir-1. For the Safir-Navid, a further 
reduction of the launch weight was required. For example, the color has been omitted. 
Further, is the thrust of the second stage slightly increased by a larger additional 
nozzle on the exhaust tube.</font></p>

TEHRAN, 2012, Febr. 04</b> -- Director of Iran Space Agency Hamid Fazeli told IRNA 
on that using the upgraded Safir satellite carrier rocket to launch the Navid satellite 
into orbit was a great scientific achievement. He said that the <b>Safir-1B</b> 
rocket enjoys more propulsion power compared to its predecessor, the Safir-1A, and 
could put into orbit the Navid satellite which weighs twice as heavy as previous 
domestically manufactured satellites.<br>
<b><br>
TEHRAN, 2012, Febr. 03</b> -- Iran launched the observation satellite <b>Navid</b> 
into Earth orbit. &quot;The Navid satellite was launched successfully.... It will be 
placed into an orbit between 250 and 370 kilometres,&quot; IRNA quoted the head of Iran&#39;s 
Space Organisation, Hamid Fazeli, as saying. The 50-kilogram satellite is meant 
to stay in orbit for 18 months, sending back images. The satellite was sent into 
orbit by a launch-vehicle dubbed Safir, which IRNA described as having 20 percent 
more launch power, compared to earlier versions of satellite carrier missiles.<br>
<b><br>
TEHRAN, 2011, Oct. 09</b> -- Head of Satellite Technical Support Department at Tehran&#39;s 
University of Science and Technology, Hossein Bolandi , announced that <b>Navid

to be put into orbit in the next three to four months with the <b>Safir-1B </b>launcher.
