   a report said.<br>
   ISNA news agency quoted Communications Minister Reza Taghipour as saying that 
   one of the three home-built communications satellites is still under construction.<br>
   Taghipour named the three satellites as <b>Toloo</b>, <b>Mesbah-2 </b>and<b> 
   Navid</b>, but did not elaborate on exactly when they would be launched. Navid, 
   Taghipour said as quoted by ISNA, was an &quot;experimental satellite&quot; and the launch 
   would be for testing camera and telecommunications equipment. Mesbah-2, which 
   is under construction, &quot;is a low-orbit telecommunication satellite for storing 
   and sending messages,&quot; he said. Iran&#39;s defence minister Ahmad Vahidi said that 
   Toloo is a &quot;reconnaissance satellite,&quot; ISNA reported. Vahidi had previously said 
   Toloo would be unveiled during celebrations in early February marking the 31st 
   anniversary of the Islamic revolution. He said last month that Toloo was designed 
   by Sa Iran, also known as Iran Electronics Industries, an affiliate company of
