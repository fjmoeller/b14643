    South Africa has existing infrastructure that could be utilised for local satellite 
    launches, notably facilities at Air Force Base Overberg. Although the launch 
    pad was destroyed as part of South Africa’s nuclear stand-down and the payload 
    processing facility was mothballed, Overberg has retained almost all of its 
    space launch capability, including mission control centre, radar and telemetry 
    tracking facilities and range safety systems, says Mark Comninos, head of Marcom 
    Aeronautics &amp; Space. The only extra modifications needed would be to re-commission 
    the payload processing facility and construct a concrete launch pad.</font></p>

    The CHEETAH-1 is a two-stage design. The vehicle will be powered by two regenerative 
    cooled liquid propellants, gas-generator cycle rocket engines. The first stage 
    would be powered by a single rocket engine with a total sea level thrust of 
    860 kN, while the second stage would have a single 58-kN engine. The complete 
    rocket would stand 31.7 m tall, including the two stages, the interstage and 
    the nose cone.<br>
    <br>
    It would be able to put a 1,000-kg payload into a 200-km orbit at an inclination 
    of 34 degrees, or a 650-kg payload into a 200-km orbit at a declination of 90 
    degrees, or a 650-kg payload into a 200-km polar orbit. It would be able to 
    accommodate payloads with a maximum diameter of 1.6 m, and a maximum length 
    of 4.2 m.</font></td>

    South Africa could be launching its own satellites as early as in 2016. This 
    was the message that Mark Comninos, CEO of Marcom Aeronautics and Space delivered 
    at the SA AMSAT Space Symposium held in Gauteng in April 2011.<br>
    Currently under development is the CHEETAH-1 CSLV, a new generation expandable 
    launch vehicle designed to meet the needs of future local and global space transportation 
    markets.<br>
    <br>
    First, Marcom Aeronautics &amp; Space is developing a rocket engine in support of 
    its CHEETAH-1 satellite launch vehicle. The MAS-10K is a 10 kN thrust, regeneratively 
    cooled, pressure fed, Liquid Oxygen/Ethanol rocket engine that is currently 
    in development, manufacture and testing. Although the MAS-10K will be the prototype 
    engine for the CHEETAH-1.<br>
    <br>
    As a prototype research and development engine with limited chamber pressure 
    and expansion ratio, the MAS-10K is not expected to be considered for flight, 
    however, with further development and testing and with the addition of an appropriate 
    radiation cooled nozzle extension, the engine could be used as an upper-stage 
    kick- motor for orbital transfer trajectories.<br>
    <br>
    These follow on engines, the MAS-58K and the MAS-860K are a technology step 
    above the MAS-10K and incorporate a variety of additional technology. “With 
    sufficient funding of these programs, MARCOM expects local launch capability 
    could be achieved within 5 years,” the company said.</font></p>

    <b>CHEETAH 1 CSLV </b><br>
    <u>Description:</u><br>
    Two stage, expendable launch vehicle designed to provide launch services to 
    inclined, polar and sun-synchronous low Earth orbits.<br>
    Performance Summary:<br>
    200 km, 34 deg 1000 kg<br>
    200 km, 90 deg 650 kg<br>
    Sun-synchronous Orbit: 800 km, 98.6 deg 439 kg<br>
    <u>Propulsion:</u><br>
    Two stages, each incorporating a regeneratively cooled, turbo-pump driven liquid 
    rocket engine operating on a gas generator thermodynamic cycle. Burning a mixture 
    of liquid Oxygen and refined Kerosene, the first stage booster is designed to 
    produce 86 tons of sea-level thrust incorporating hydraulic thrust vector control 
    for pitch, yaw and roll control. The second stage is designed to produce 5.8 
    tons of vacuum thrust steered similarly via electromechanical actuators.<br>
    <u>Avionics:</u><br>
    Triple redundant flight control computers, receiving navigation data from triple 
    redundant strap-down inertial navigation systems provide vehicle ascent control. 
    Real time telemetry data, flight termination and ground tracking systems provide 
    for reliability and safety of the system during ascent.<br>
    <u>Payload Accommodations:</u><br>
    Usable Diameter 1.6 m<br>
    Usable Cylindrical Length 2.4 m<br>
    Usable Conical Length 1.8 m<br>

    Maximum Lateral Acceleration 2.0 g<br>
    <u>Fuselage:</u><br>
    Semi-monocoque Aluminium skin/stringer and carbon fiber matrix composites. Tanks, 
    Aluminum alloy.</font></td>
