      launch of a big rocket that day. Debris has fallen near Pyongyang. The failure

      It is possible that this failed launch was the first attempt to test a single-stage 
      HS-17+TR with 6 engines (3x2 combustors), that use as the first stage of the

      place at the Sohae SLG on the afternoon of December 7. The Academy of the 
      National Defence Scienc of the DPRK made a report on the successful test of 
      great significance to the Central Commitee of the Worker&#39;s Party.&quot;</font><font size="2" color="#FF00FF"><br>

      stage on the Sohae SLG (?)</b><br>
&nbsp;<i>Comment: .The engine test stand is untouched. The various small materials 
      (not a container, only a long shadow) are an indication of construction works 
      in the adjacent building during the past days. The old scrap in front of a 
      bunker has not been removed yet. Further presented &quot;evidence&quot; for use the 
      test stand are ridiculous.<br>
      NK does not have to test a new engine. They have tested everything they need, 
      even an engine with two combustors (HS-15). Now they only have to test an 
      interaction of several engines (3x2 = 6?) for a SLV. So I suspected a static 
      test on the launch pad. Why are there no current satellite photos of the Sohae 
      SLG. </i></font></p>
