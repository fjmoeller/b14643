    On the launch pad, the rail-mounted transfer building is being reassembled. 
    Two support cranes are observed at the building, the walls have been erected 
    and a new roof added. The walls appear to be one segment taller than the previous 
    transfer building and new truss is being installed. The materials that have 
    been stacked on the pad over the past few months are gone.<br>
    At the engine test stand, it appears that the engine support structure is being 
    reassembled. Two cranes are present and construction materials are spread across 
    the stand’s apron. New roofs have been installed on the old fuel and oxidizer 
    buildings (<i>Not new roofs for the old bunkers. There seems to be a lot of 
    time pressure, because not all the ruins are eliminated yet</i>).<br>
    Based on commercial satellite imagery, efforts to rebuild 
    these structures started sometime between February 16 and March 2, 2019.Not new roofs for the old bunkers. There seems to be a lot of time pressure, because not all the ruins are eliminated yet.</p>

    Comment on the surprising dismantling of the &quot;SLV Transfer Structure&quot; on the 
    Sohae SLF</b></font></p>
    <p align="left"><b><font color="#000080">It is more than surprising that North 
    Korea is dismantling its SLV Transfer Structure, which was completed just three 
    years ago. But this action (as well as the dismantling of the superstructure 
    of the engine teststand) has nothing to do with the nuclear program or ICBM 
    development. With the dismantling of the transfer structure, North Korea deprive 
    itself the ability to launch SLV&#39;s for a period of time. But that is calculated. 
    It is only a goodwill signal. The Unha-3 is no longer used and the new Unha-X 
    is not yet operational. The transfer structure can be reassembled at short time, 
    maybe in an improved version. In any case, North Korea will not end its space 
    ambitions.</font></b></p>

        <b>North Korea Begins Dismantling Key Facilities at the Sohae Satellite 
        Launching Station</b><br>
        <br>
        &quot;Commercial satellite imagery of the launch pad from July 20 shows that 
        the rail-mounted processing/transfer structure has been moved to the middle 
        of the pad, exposing the underground rail transfer point—one of the few 
        times it has been seen in this location. The roof and supporting structure 
        have been partially removed and numerous vehicles are present—including 
        a large construction crane. An image from two days later shows the continued 
        presence of the crane and vehicles. Considerable progress has been made 
        in dismantling the rail-mounted processing/transfer structure. One corner 
        has been completely dismantled and the parts can be seen lying on the ground. 
        In both images the two fuel/oxidizer bunkers, main processing building and 
        gantry tower remain untouched.&quot;</p>
        <p><b>Air&nbsp; Defense &amp; Space, August 03: </b>It seems to prove my thesis 
        that this is just a reconstruction of the Transfer Structure. The demolition 
        has not progressed and the crane has been removed. Everything indicates 
        that the test stand will also undergo a reconstruction. The partial removal 
        of the roofs on the fuel bunkers is only for the purpose of replacing the 
        tanks.<br>
