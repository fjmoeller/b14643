      At the launch pad, work on the rail-mounted transfer structure appears to 
      have been completed by March 6 and the structure may now be operational. The 
      cranes have been removed from the pad and the overhead trusses that were being 
      installed on the roof have been covered. The mobile structure is now situated 
      at the far end of the launch pad adjacent to the checkout building. Several 
      vehicles are parked near the<u> </u>now closed again gantry tower.</p>

      On the launch pad, the rail-mounted transfer building is being reassembled. 
      Two support cranes are observed at the building, the walls have been erected 
      and a new roof added. The walls appear to be one segment taller (<i>no !</i>) 
      than the previous transfer building and new truss is being installed. The 
      materials that have been stacked on the pad over the past few months are gone. The environmental covers around the umbilical tower have been opened.</p>

          <b>North Korea Begins Dismantling Key Facilities at the Sohae Satellite 
          Launching Station</b><br>
          Commercial satellite imagery of the launch pad from July 20 shows that 
          the rail-mounted processing/transfer structure has been moved to the 
          middle of the pad, exposing the underground rail transfer point—one of 
          the few times it has been seen in this location. The roof and 
          supporting structure have been partially removed and numerous vehicles 
          are present—including a large construction crane. An image from two 
          days later shows the continued presence of the crane and vehicles. 
          Considerable progress has been made in dismantling the rail-mounted 
          processing/transfer structure. One corner has been completely 
          dismantled and the parts can be seen lying on the ground. In both 
          images the two fuel/oxidizer bunkers, main processing building and 
          gantry tower remain untouched.</p>
          <p><b>Air&nbsp; Defense &amp; Space, August 03: </b>It seems to prove my thesis 
          that this is just a reconstruction of the Transfer Structure. The demolition 
          has not progressed and the crane has been removed.<br>
