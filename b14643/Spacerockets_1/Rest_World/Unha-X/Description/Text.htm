      bunker has not been removed yet. Further presented &quot;evidence&quot; for use the

      NK does not have to test a new engine. They have tested everything they need, 
      even an engine with two combustors (HS-15). Now they only have to test an 
      interaction of several engines (3x2 = 6?) for a SLV. So I suspected a static 
      test on the launch pad. Why are there no current satellite photos of the Sohae 
      SLG. </i><br>

      of 2017 an analyst should be clear that the engine &quot;Pektusan&quot; primarily is 
      qualified for a future Unha-X, as well as what configuration the future SLV 
      will have. Equipped with the engine &quot;Pektusan&quot; the HS-12, HS-14 and HS-15 
      have served in addition to the demonstration of supposedly military strength 
      also for the qualification of the engine. In the meantime they master the 
      engine perfectly. It can be equipped with one or two combustors (Pektusan-A1 
      / -A2) and was even presented a gimbal type engine (Pektusan-B). It is very 
      likely that the HS-15 with the gimbal type engine (Pektusan-B) is identical 
      to a second stage of the Unha-X. For a first stage, three Pektusan-A2 engines 
      may be used, where, like the RD-250, the turbopump is mounted on a platform. 
      For control then four additional smaller engines are required. For a third 
      stage, the engines of the second stage of the Unha-3 are expected to be used.<br>

      <b>2014 - 2016</b> -- Commercial satellite imagery indicates that North Korea 
      preparing the Sohae Satellite Launching Station (“Tongchang-ri”) for launching 
      of a new larger space launch vehicle. The Sohae gantry tower has been undergoing 
      significant modifications. So will be increased the gantry about three sections 
      of 46 m to 60 m (without crane) !<br>
      The rocket by a source is described &quot;as a booster for a super ICBM or a heavy-lift 
      space launcher. It is completely new from what they have done so far.&quot; <br>
      It could be a totally changed space launcher with 3 m diameter and new engines. 
      But North Korea has not the know-how to develop new large engines. That can 
      only mean that already exist the technical requirements for such a propulsion.</font></p>

      What was previously just a guess, seems to be confirmed: North Korea has at 
      least blueprints of an old Soviet ICBM engine. The new North Korean engine 
      &quot;<b><font color="#FF0000">Pektusan</font></b>&quot; is clearly comparable<b><font color="#FF0000">
      </font></b>to the RD-250 engine of the KB Glushko. Two combustors use a common 
      turbopump. Typical is the low arrangement of the TP between the nozzles.
      <br>
      It is pointless to suggest that there is another engine. It is completely 
      clear that there is a pair with a turbopump in the middle, mounted on a platform. 
      Such engines has constructed only Glushko. North Korea have not the know-how 
      to develop an engine of this magnitude itself.<br>
      The display (left) shows only one engine for the test. The lowered TP on the 
      platform makes sense only when a second engine is added in future.</font></p>
