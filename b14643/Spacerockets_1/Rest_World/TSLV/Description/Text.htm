    Little has been publicly revealed about the specification of Taiwan&#39;s first 
    Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV). It should be able to place a 50 kg payload to 
    a 500–700 km orbit with a 22.3 degrees inclination angle and a tip-off rate 
    of less than 10 degrees per axis.<br>
    This SLV will be an upgrade based on existing sounding rockets and will consist 
    of <b>four solid propellant stages with two strap-on solid rocket boosters</b>. 
    Therefore it will be in the same class of the Indian SLV-3. The inaugural launch 
    is scheduled to take place during the second phase of the 2004-2018 space project, 
    placing an indigenously-made satellite into orbit and after the preparatory 
    launches of 10 to 15 sounding rockets.</font></p>

    </b>The National Space Organization (NSPO) is currently engaged in a 15-year 
    space technology development program that focuses on the development of innovative 
    and emerging technologies completely in-country. The program is to strengthen 
    the self-reliance of the Taiwan space industry, and position it to meet current 
    and future needs of the Taiwan space program. Under this context, the NSPO has 
    long taken efforts in designing aerospace components, fabricating payload instruments 
    for suborbital and orbital spaceflights, improving rocket technologies, establishing 
    test flight platforms, and gaining a better understanding of the Earth&#39;s plasma 
    environment and of other events in the ionosphere. The latter can interfere 
    with radio communications, global positioning systems (GPS), ground electrical 
    systems, and low-Earth satellite orbits.</font></p>

    on the <b>Tien Kung missile</b>, at the start supported by an additional solid 
    booster with a diameter of 0.57 m. The diameter of the Tien Kung&nbsp; is 0.41 
    m.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" color="#000080">Tien-Kung, a surface-to-air missile 
    system designed for air defense against intensive aircraft attack,equipped with 
    a single stage dual thrust solid propellant rocket motor and guided by mid-course 
    inertial reference and radar in the terminal phase, is capable of multi-target 
    tracking and automatic multi-target engagement. In 1993 Taiwan bought surface-to-air 
    missile (SAM) system components from Raytheon of the USA. There were direct 
    offsets - joint development and technology transfers. Taiwan is to develop and 
    produce this Tien Kung SAM system, a derivative of the Patriot PAC-2 missile.
