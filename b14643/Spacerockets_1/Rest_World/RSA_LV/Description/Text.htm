    <td width="63%"><font color="#000080" size="2">Israel and South Africa collaborated 
    closely in rocket technology in the 1970´s and 1980´s. As a cover for and supplement 
    to the missile development, a space program was funded. This would use the RSA-3 
    and RSA-4 launchers. Following the decision in 1989 to cancel the nuclear weapons 
    program, the missile programs were allowed to continue until 1992, when military 
    funding ended and South Africa officially ended its missile collaboration with 
    Israel. The RSA-3 and RSA-4 space launchers were therefore cancelled in June 
    1994.<br>
    The first two rockets, designated <b>RSA-1</b> and <b>RSA-2</b>, were test-flown 
    on ballistic missile trajectories, their flights ending in the sea: 01.06.1989: 
    altidude 100 km; 06.07.1989: altitude 300 km; 19.11.1990: altitude 300 km</font><p>
    <font color="#000080" size="2">The third was modified into a satellite launch 
    vehicle <b>RSA-3</b> but never launched.<br>
    To reassure the international community, the administration of President de 
    Klerk scrapped the MRBM/SLV program. The physical infrastructure was demolished, 
    and the technical specialists were transferred, retrenched, retired and some 
    resigned – a significant number emigrated.<br>
    <br>
    The </font><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><b>RSA-3</b> </font>
    <font color="#000080" size="2">launcher (sy. <b>Arniston</b>) began development 
    in the 1980´s. The RSA-3 was developed by the Houwteq. The Overberg Test Range 
    near Cape Town was used for test flights. The first and second stages of RSA-3 
    used the same rocket motor loaded with 9 tonnes of propellant. The first stage 
    used vanes in the exhaust for steering during the first 16 to 20 seconds of 
    flight, after which the fins at the base of the vehicle provided aerodynamic 
    control. The second stage had a higher expansion nozzle and may have been equipped 
    with TVC for steering. Atop the second stage was a guidance / orientation / 
    spin-up bus for the third stage and payload. Total mass of this bus and the 
    payload shroud was 583 kg. After second stage burnout, the upper stage package 
    entered a <u>148 second ballistic coast</u>. A sideways trajectory deflection was made 
    and the shroud was jettisoned. Then the third stage and payload were spun up, 
    following by separation of the bus. The spin-stabilised third stage then made 
    the 4,555 m/s burn to place the payload into orbit.<br>
    The composite payload fairing for the RSA-3 was 4.5 m long, 1.3 m in diameter, 
    and had a mass of 57 kg.</font><br>
    <br>
    <font color="#000080" size="2">The <b>RSA-4 </b>launcher was planned follow-on 
    to the RSA-3. A large new first stage optimised the vehicle and more than doubled 
    the payload in comparison to the RSA-3. The planned first stage should be a 
    new development. The second and third stage were essentially those of the RSA-3.<br>
    <br>
    <u>Houwteq</u> was the prime contractor in the RSA space industry. Houwteq is 
    offering a comprehensive launch service with its RSA-4 launch vehicle from Overberg 
    Test Range for MEO earth satellite constellations. This RSA-4 comprise three 
    solid propellant boost stage and a hydrazine powered fourth stage for orbit 
    injection. It can lift a mass of 0.550 t into a circular orbit at a high of 
    1,400 km or 0.570 t into 800 km polar orbit. Provision is made for a payload 
    volume of 10.4 m3.</font></p>

    <td width="54%"><font color="#000080" size="2">The South African RSA-3 launch 
    vehicle was designed to place a small surveillance satellite, named <b>Greensat</b>, 
    of 330 kg mass into a 41 degree, 212 x 460 km orbit around the earth. Following 
    cancellation of the military missile program in 1989, the project was reoriented 
    to civilian uses, with the declared missions of vehicle tracking and regional 
    planning. <br>
    The solar array for the satellite had a mass of under 7 kg and with three panels 
    could supply 295 W of power. Certain technology on the satellite was probably 
    derived from that of the Israeli Ofeq satellites. However Greensat was over 
    twice the mass of the Ofeq, due to the favorable launch azimuth for the RSA-3 
    launch vehicle from South Africa as compared to due-West launch of the similar 
    Shavit booster from Israel. </font>
    <p><font size="2" color="#000080">Houwteq (from 1992, Denel) attempted to continue 
    marketing the RSA-3 and RSA-4 as space launch vehicles and repurposed the surveillance 
    satellite. But orders were never forthcoming and the entire program was cancelled.</font></p>
