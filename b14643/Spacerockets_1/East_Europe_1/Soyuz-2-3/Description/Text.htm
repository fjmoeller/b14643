<p style="margin-bottom:0; margin-top:0"><font color="#000080" size="2">The Soyuz-2-3 
launch vehicle would serve as an intermediate step between Soyuz-2 and Soyuz-3 launch 
vehicles in the effort to upgrade the oldest family among Russian space boosters. 
The concept of the Soyuz-2-3 emerged during 2005, when RKK Energia settled on the 
Soyuz-based rockets as a launch vehicle for the prospective Kliper orbiter. The 
Soyuz-2-3 would be capable of launching a &quot;light&quot; version of the Kliper spacecraft, 
as well as the unmanned cargo container.</font><br>
<font color="#000080" size="2">Like the Soyuz-3 launcher, the Soyuz-2-3 apparently 
borrowed body dimensions for the 1st and 2nd stages from the Aurora project -- a 
short-lived commercial venture aimed to launch the Soyuz-based rockets from Christmas 
Island in the Indian Ocean. <br>
The first stage, traditionally comprised of four conical strap-on boosters, would 
be equipped with a new RD-0155 engine developed by KBKhA design bureau in Voronezh 
and burning a mix of kerosene and liquid oxygen.<br>
The top section of the 2nd stage (also known as &quot;core&quot; or &quot;sustainer&quot; stage) would 
have a cylindrical shape with the constant diameter, as oppose to conical shape 
in the earlier versions of the Soyuz rocket. It would enable the core stage of the 
Soyuz-2-3 to carry as much as 40 tons more propellant in comparison to the core 
stage of the Soyuz-2.<br>
Like Aurora, the second stage would be equipped with the modified NK-33 engine. 
The NK-33-1 engine would be able to develop up to 170 tons of thrust (from 150 tons 
in the N-1 rocket) and it could be gimbaled up to 15 degrees, eliminating the need 
for steering thrusters, traditionally present on all booster stages in the Soyuz 
family. <br>
Despite these improvements, the Soyuz-2-3 would be a less radical upgrade of the 
family than the Soyuz-3 booster, since the former would not employ liquid hydrogen 
on the third stage.</font><br>
<br>
<font size="2" color="#000080">At the beginning of 2006, RKK Energia and TsSKB Progress 
agreed to a three-stage development plan for the Soyuz-2-3 project. The first version 
of the rocket would carry 11 tons into circular orbit delivering, commercial and 
military satellites. In the second development phase, the payload would be increased 
to 13 tons, thanks to the introduction of the RD-0155 engine on the first stage. 
This would enable the vehicle to carry the &quot;light&quot; version of the Kliper. Finally, 
during the third phase, the payload would grow to 15-16 tons and above, giving the 
rocket enough power to launch the &quot;heavy&quot; version of the Kliper.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#800080" size="2">Meanwhile 
the first conceptions for the development the Soyuz-2-3 were total changed. Unclear 
is the selected diameter of the upper part the core-stage. The core-stage is now 
like the Soyuz-2.1v in any case conical formed with a maximum diameter of 3.50-3.70 
m. As always an gimbaled engine NK-33-1 should be used for the core-stage. The extended 
lower part of the core-stage has an diameter of&nbsp; 2.66 m. The boosters (first 
stage) should remain unchanged. They are identically with the boosters of the Soyuz-2. 
New is the cryogenic third stage (Block - E) with four engines RD-0146E. This Block-E 
was previously concepted for the Soyuz-3. The kick-stage can be a Fregat.</font></p>
