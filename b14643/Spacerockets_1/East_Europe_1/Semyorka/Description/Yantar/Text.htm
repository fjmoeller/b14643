The development of the next high precision space mapping system began at the Central 
Specialized Design Bureau in Samara in 1972. The Yantar-1KF system was developed 
on the basis of the first high precision space reconnaissance satellite Yantar-2K 
(Feniks) with a reentry vehicle of the previous generation of Zenit satellites being 
attached to it. The first Yantar-1KF (Siluet) was launched from Baikonur cosmodrome 
on February 18, 1981 under the official name of Kosmos-1246.<br>

</b>Foreign space experts attribute these satellites to the fourth generation of 
Soviet/Russian photoreconnaissance satellites. At the time of their development 
they were called Yantar-4K1 and Yantar-4K2 during, and after being adopted by the 
Soviet Armed Forces Oktant/Kobalt.<br>
The first satellite of the family was developed in the early 1970s at the Central 
Specialized Design Bureau in Samara. The cameras with the extended lens and a store 
of film were placed in the conical main descent module of the satellite. Thanks 
to deorbited capsules, the films were dropped to surface in three portions: two 
in capsules and one with the camera in its reentry vehicle. The first satellite 
in the Yantar-4K series was launched on April 27, 1979. <br>

one year. However, so far there have been no reports that images from Neman would

(Don) spacecraft<br>
</b>In May 1977 the Central Specialized Design Bureau in Samara decided to develop 
several new photo-intelligence satellites. The models suggested for development 
included the Orlets system for large swath high resolution and panoramic photography 
with faster data delivery.<br>
Under the plan the system was supposed to be developed in two stages. At the first 
stage the main parameters were to be achieved that did not require a significant 
change in the satellite weight. At the second, after the development the Zenit-2 
launch vehicle with a greater payload than Soyuz-U a modification satellite was 
supposed to be developed fully meeting the requirements of customers.</font></p>

    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" color="#000080">In 
    1981-1985 work was under way to develop Orlets of the first stage (sometimes 
    known as Orlets-1). The satellite had a capsule machine with eight capsules. 
    It was designed for being orbited by Soyuz-U or Soyuz-U2&nbsp; launch vehicles. 
    The first launch took place on July 18, 1989. On August 25, 1992, the system 
    was approved for operation under the name of Don.&nbsp; So far six satellites 
    of this type have been launched. The last two operated for 102 and 120 days 
    respectively.<br>
    When the second stage of developing Orlets was launched, Orlets-1 was evidently 
    chosen as the prototype and a new capsule machine for 22 capsules was designed 
    for it. Thanks to this its lifetime could be increased almost four-fold to 160-180 
    days leaving the pace of deorbiting ex­posed films to earth unchanged.<br>
    In 1994 the design work and ground testing of Orlets of the second generation 
    were completed. The first flight test of Orlets-2 was conducted between August 
    26, 1994 and April 4, 1995. The mission lasted for 224 days. Even though Orlets-2 
    made only one test flight, on November 30, 1997 it was adopted for service and 
    designated Yenisei. The second Orlets-2 was in orbit between Septembers 25, 
    2000 and April 20, 2001.<b><br>

    two civilian projects are the closest to implementation: Resurs-P and Resurs-DK1 
    (Progress Space Center, Samara), the Monitor family of satellites (the Khrunichev 
    State Research and Production Space Center - the Khrunichev Center, Moscow) 
    and the Kondor family satellites (the Machine-Building Research and Production 
    Association - NPOmash, Reutov). <br>
    In 1996 it proposed to the Russian Aviation and Space Agency the Resurs-DK project 
    for large swath photography.&nbsp; In December 1996 the agency approved the 
    project and included it in the Federal Space Program. The operating life of 
    Resurs-DK was set at three years. <br>
    The first Resurs-DK was supposed to be launched in 1999 or 2000. However, evidently 
    due to financial problems the first launch was put off several times. As a result 
    a new, simpler modification evolved with a smaller number of spectral bands. 
    In 1997 the modification made its debut at the Paris international aerospace 
    show in Le Bourget. A year later it was designated Resurs-DK1. <br>
    In appearance of Resurs-DK1 greatly resembles the Neman optic-electronic intelligence 
    satellite. Evidently, both rely on the same optical equipment. The first satellite 
    Resurs-DK1 was launched on June 15, 2006<br>
