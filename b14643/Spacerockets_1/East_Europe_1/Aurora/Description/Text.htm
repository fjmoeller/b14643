    The </font><font color="#FF0000">Aurora</font><font color="#000080"> launch 
    vehicle is a Russian designed an manufactured upgrate rocket &quot;Soyuz&quot; capable 
    of delivering satellites to both LEO and GTO. The upgrades include the replacement 
    of the strap-on and stage 1 engines with more powerful RD-107A and NK-33 engines 
    respectively and increasing the diameter of stage one and of stage two. For 
    launches to high orbits, a new upper stage called Corvet is introduced. It is 
    based on the Block-DM. The proposed launch site will be Christmas Island.<br>
    <br>
    </font></font><font color="#000080" size="2">Asia Pacific Space Centre (APSC) 
    plans to use a new spaceport being developed on Christmas Island, an Australian 
    territory located in the northeast India Ocean.<br>
    Australia&#39;s Asia Pacific Space Centre has joined with Roskosmos, RKK Energya, 
    Samara Central Specialized Design Bureau and Progress Plant (TsSKB Progress) 
    and the Design Bureau of General Machine Building (KBOM). <br>
    The first commercial launch out of Australia&#39;s Christmas Island was planned 
    for the last quarter of 2003. Now the company will commence launch operations 
    in 2006. APSC will commence commercial operations after the conduct of a Test 
    Launch in mid 2004.&nbsp; In excess of nine launches per annum are forecast 
    by 2007.<br>
    <br>
    The Aurora launch vehicle is comprised of either three or four stages. The three-stage 
    basic configuration is used to deliver payloads to low earth orbit. The four-stage 
    configuration is used to deliver payloads to high-energy orbits including geosynchronous 
    transfer orbit. Aurora is capable of delivering 4350 kg - 4500 kg to a geosynchronous 
    transfer orbit with an orbit inclination of 10.5 degrees. <br>
    All four stages of the Aurora LV use liquid oxygen and kerosene propellants, 
    which are both safe to handle and environmentally responsible.<br>
    Stage-1 includes four boosters that are laterally attached to a core stage. 
    The four boosters are powered by the RD-107A propulsion system manufactured 
    by NPO Energomash. The lateral boosters are derived from hardware used on the 
    highly reliable and man-rated Soyuz launch vehicle.<br>
    The core stage (stage 2) also has design heritage from other reliable flight 
    systems; its tanks have been stretched to carry 50 tons more useable propellant 
    than previous configurations. The flight control system has been adapted from 
    one used on the Blok-DM upper stage. The core stage is powered by the NK-33 
    propulsion system.<br>
    Stage 1 and stage 2 are both manufactured by TsSKB-Progress, a world leader 
    in the production of space launch hardware and booster systems. TsSKB-Progress 
    also supplies the payload fairing.<br>
    Auroras&#39;s third stage is manufactured by RSC Energya. It is a stretched version 
    of a flight-proven Block-I stage. It is powered by the RD-0154 propulsion system 
    and is designed to boost the payload unit (upper stage and payload) to near 
    orbital conditions.<br>
    The fourth or upper stage, called Corvet, is also manufactured by RSC Energya 
    and is related to upper stages used on other Russian launch systems. The stage 
    is capable of long life in space and multiple engine restarts, and is designed 
    to interface with typical commercial spacecraft buses. The stage uses liquid 
    oxygen and napthyl (kerosene) and is powered by the NPO Veronezh-built 11D58M 
    propulsion system.</font></td>

</font><font color="#000080" size="2">Aurora would replace the RD-108 engine on 
the Soyuz second stage with a much higher performance NK-33 engine. The LOX tank 
diameter is increased to 3.4 m (11,2 ft) to accommodate the higher mixture ratio 
of the staged-combustion engines. The third stage would be based on the Soyuz Block- 
I and would also be enlarged to 3.4 m (11.2 ft) in diameter. The new Corvet fourth 
stage would be used for injection in GTO. It resembles a smaller version of the 
Block DM stage, with nearly spherical LOX tank, a toroidal kerosene tank, and 11D58M 
engine with an extendible nozzle for increased performance. The combination of these 
performance improvements and the near-equatorial launch site will provide Aurora 
with much greater performance than the existing Soyuz. Maximum payload to a 200-km 
(108-nmi) 11-deg orbit would be 12,000 kg (26,500 lbm). If launched from Baikonur, 
Aurora could carry 10,600 kg (23,400 lbm) to a 200 km (108 nmi), 51.6 deg orbit. 
Up to 4,500 kg (9,900 lbm) can be delivered to GTO at 11 deg, or 2,100 kg (4,600 
lbm) to GEO. Aurora could be operational from Christmas Island by 2005. Earlier 
test flights may be launched from Baikonur at LC 250; the launch complex used for 
the maiden launch of the Energia heavy launch vehicle. However, the downturn in 
the commercial launch market has made the future of Aurora uncertain. The French 
have also attempted to quash the project, seeing it as a competitor to their own 
plans to provide near-equatorial launches of Soyuz from Kourou through Starsem and 
Arianespace.</font></p>

<span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"><b>At the end of 1999</b> the 
project was radically changed. Now the central unit of the LV called Unit 3 carries 
a combined propulsion system consisting of one NK-33</span><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">M</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"> 
in the middle and one four-chamber RD-0110R on the outside. The four chambers of 
RD-0110R are used as sustainer control engines. The four side units of the Yamal 
rocket (A Units) remain the same as on Soyuz with the 14D22 propulsion system. The 
third stage (Unit 4) is equipped with one four-chamber RD-0124A with a high-altitude 
nozzle as on Soyuz-2K. It has been decided to couple such a Yamal developed on the 
basis of a Soyuz with a new booster. Initially the booster was supposed to be developed 
on the basis of LM unit with an 11D58MF engine and an 8-ton fuel intake. Now this 
is a modification of the Proryv unit with the same engine and 10-ton fuel intake 
(Unit 2). The Yamal based on a Soyuz rocket is to be developed by 2003. However, 
the greater degree of standardization has reduced the payload: while its old version 
could inject 14 tons in LEO (Hcir=200 km, i=51degrees), now only 12 tons despite 
the same launch weight of 360 tons.</span></font></p>
