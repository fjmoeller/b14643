      </font><b><font color="#FF0000">The Aurora launch vehicle</font></b> is a 
      Russian designed an manufactured upgrate rocket &quot;Soyuz&quot; capable of delivering 
      satellites to both LEO and GTO. The upgrades include the replacement of the 
      strap-on and stage 1 engines with more powerful RD-107A and NK-33 engines 
      respectively and increasing the diameter of stage one and of stage two. For 
      launches to high orbits, a new upper stage called Corvet is introduced. It 
      is based on the Block-DM. The proposed launch site will be Christmas Island.<br>
      <br>
      Asia Pacific Space Centre (APSC) plans to use a new spaceport being developed 
      on Christmas Island, an Australian territory located in the northeast India 
      Ocean.<br>
      Australia&#39;s Asia Pacific Space Centre has joined with Roskosmos, RKK Energya, 
      Samara Central Specialized Design Bureau and Progress Plant (TsSKB Progress) 
      and the Design Bureau of General Machine Building (KBOM). <br>
      The first commercial launch out of Australia&#39;s Christmas Island was planned 
      for the last quarter of 2003. Now the company will commence launch operations 
      in 2006. APSC will commence commercial operations after the conduct of a Test 
      Launch in mid 2004.&nbsp; In excess of nine launches per annum are forecast 
      by 2007.<br>
      <br>
      The Aurora launch vehicle is comprised of either three or four stages. The 
      three-stage basic configuration is used to deliver payloads to low earth orbit. 
      The four-stage configuration is used to deliver payloads to high-energy orbits 
      including geosynchronous transfer orbit. Aurora is capable of delivering 4350 
      kg - 4500 kg to a geosynchronous transfer orbit with an orbit inclination 
      of 10.5 degrees. <br>
      All four stages of the Aurora LV use liquid oxygen and kerosene propellants, 
      which are both safe to handle and environmentally responsible.<br>
      Stage-1 includes four boosters that are laterally attached to a core stage. 
      The four boosters are powered by the RD-107A propulsion system manufactured 
      by NPO Energomash. The lateral boosters are derived from hardware used on 
      the highly reliable and man-rated Soyuz launch vehicle.<br>
      The core stage (stage 2) also has design heritage from other reliable flight 
      systems; its tanks have been stretched to carry 50 tons more useable propellant 
      than previous configurations. The flight control system has been adapted from 
      one used on the Blok-DM upper stage. The core stage is powered by the NK-33 
      propulsion system.<br>
      Stage 1 and stage 2 are both manufactured by TsSKB-Progress, a world leader 
      in the production of space launch hardware and booster systems. TsSKB-Progress 
      also supplies the payload fairing.<br>
      Auroras&#39;s third stage is manufactured by RSC Energya. It is a stretched version 
      of a flight-proven Block-I stage. It is powered by the RD-0154 propulsion 
      system and is designed to boost the payload unit (upper stage and payload) 
      to near orbital conditions.<br>
      The fourth or upper stage, called Corvet, is also manufactured by RSC Energya 
      and is related to upper stages used on other Russian launch systems. The stage 
      is capable of long life in space and multiple engine restarts, and is designed 
      to interface with typical commercial spacecraft buses. The stage uses liquid 
      oxygen and napthyl (kerosene) and is powered by the NPO Veronezh-built 11D58M 
      propulsion system.</font><p><u><font size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Aurora would replace the RD-108 engine on the Soyuz second stage with a much 
      higher performance NK-33 engine. The LOX tank diameter is increased to 3.4 
      m (11,2 ft) to accommodate the higher mixture ratio of the staged-combustion 
      engines. The third stage would be based on the Soyuz Block- I and would also 
      be enlarged to 3.4 m (11.2 ft) in diameter. The new Corvet fourth stage would 
      be used for injection in GTO. It resembles a smaller version of the Block 
      DM stage, with nearly spherical LOX tank, a toroidal kerosene tank, and 11D58M 
      engine with an extendible nozzle for increased performance. The combination 
      of these performance improvements and the near-equatorial launch site will 
      provide Aurora with much greater performance than the existing Soyuz. Maximum 
      payload to a 200-km (108-nmi) 11-deg orbit would be 12,000 kg (26,500 lbm). 
      If launched from Baikonur, Aurora could carry 10,600 kg (23,400 lbm) to a 
      200 km (108 nmi), 51.6 deg orbit. Up to 4,500 kg (9,900 lbm) can be delivered 
      to GTO at 11 deg, or 2,100 kg (4,600 lbm) to GEO. Aurora could be operational 
      from Christmas Island by 2005. Earlier test flights may be launched from Baikonur 
      at LC 250; the launch complex used for the maiden launch of the Energia heavy 
      launch vehicle. However, the downturn in the commercial launch market has 
      made the future of Aurora uncertain. The French have also attempted to quash 
      the project, seeing it as a competitor to their own plans to provide near-equatorial 
      launches of Soyuz from Kourou through Starsem and Arianespace.</font></p>

      At the end of 1999</b> the project was radically changed. Now the central 
      unit of the LV called Unit 3 carries a combined propulsion system consisting 
      of one NK-33</span><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB">M</span><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-ansi-language:EN-GB"> 
      in the middle and one four-chamber RD-0110R on the outside. The four chambers 
      of RD-0110R are used as sustainer control engines. The four side units of 
      the Yamal rocket (A Units) remain the same as on Soyuz with the 14D22 propulsion 
      system. The third stage (Unit 4) is equipped with one four-chamber RD-0124A 
      with a high-altitude nozzle as on Soyuz-2K. It has been decided to couple 
      such a Yamal developed on the basis of a Soyuz with a new booster. Initially 
      the booster was supposed to be developed on the basis of LM unit with an 11D58MF 
      engine and an 8-ton fuel intake. Now this is a modification of the Proryv 
      unit with the same engine and 10-ton fuel intake (Unit 2). The Yamal based 
      on a Soyuz rocket is to be developed by 2003. However, the greater degree 
      of standardization has reduced the payload: while its old version could inject 
      14 tons in LEO (Hcir=200 km, i=51degrees), now only 12 tons despite the same 
      launch weight of 360 tons.</span></font></p>
