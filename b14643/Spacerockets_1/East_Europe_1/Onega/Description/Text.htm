<p><font size="2" color="#000080">Russia&#39;s Energya company is also planning to upgrade 
the Soyuz booster with an new second cryogenic second stage Block E (with RD-0146E) 
and third cryogenic stage &quot;Yastreb&quot; (with RD-0126) and upper stage units, capable 
of making geostationary orbit missions for GEO 2.3 tons. The name of this mostly 
upgraded Soyuz is Onega.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#000080">A meeting of the Council of Chief Designers chaired 
by Designer General, member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Semenov was held 
at Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia to review the results of the initial 
development phase of the project for space launcher system Onega, which is to be 
operated from launch site at Plesetsk, Russia.<br>
The system is being developed on the basis of a radical upgrade of the highly-reliable 
medium-capacity launch vehicle Soyuz, building on the experience and advances gained 
in the course of work on the development of advanced space launcher systems, including 
such areas as rocket engine engineering, development of on-board systems for automatic 
control of launch vehicles, upper stages and spacecraft, ground infrastructure facilities. 
The project envisions addressing a broad spectrum of tasks related to the orbital 
insertion of spacecraft for various applications into Earth obits, including the 
geostationary orbit. In order to be able to launch from Plesetsk into high-energy 
orbits, it is planned to use a newly developed third stage and a space upper stage 
with propulsion units using oxygen + hydrogen as propellants.<br>
It is planned to upgrade the launch vehicle performance in several steps, in particular, 
through the use on the upper stage of a solar propulsion unit using oxygen + hydrogen 
as its propellant. These measures will allow to increase the upmass to the geostationary 
orbit to values that are comparable with the performance of the existing and future 
modifications of heavy launch vehicles operated from Baikonur.<br>
The prime developer for the Onega system is RSC Energia. The project is being developed 
by the leaders in the Russian rocket and space industry.</font></p>
