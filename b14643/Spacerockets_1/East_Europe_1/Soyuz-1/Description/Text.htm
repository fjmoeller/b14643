    (Source: Anatoly Zak, RussianSpaceWeb)</font><font color="#000080" size="1"><br>
    </font></b><font size="1" color="#000080"><br>
    &quot;During the first decade of the 21st century, TsSKB Progress in Samara, the 
    developer of the Soyuz series of rockets, continued efforts to upgrade this 
    legendary family of launchers. Around 2007, following its strategy of modest 
    improvements with limited funds, TsSKB Progress proposed yet another intermediate 
    step on the road to integrating NK-33 engines inherited from N1 rocket into 
    the Soyuz family.<br>
    Designated Soyuz-1, the new light-weight vehicle would use a core stage fitted 
    with a single NK-33-1 engine, but without strap-on boosters typical for the 
    Soyuz family. Also the diameter of the lower section of the core stage would 
    be increased from 2,050 to 2,660 millimeters.<br>
    According to the information released at the ILA-2008 show in Berlin, a two-stage, 
    136-ton Soyuz-1 rocket was designed to deliver payloads ranging from 1.5 to 
    2.4 tons from Plesetsk into the low-Earth orbit with the inclination 62.5 degrees 
    toward the Equator. By 2009, the launch mass of the vehicle grew to 158.5 tons. 
    In 2010, TsSKB Progress quoted 157-160 tons as the launch mass. The vehicle 
    would be 44 meters tall.<br>
    Soon after the cancelation of the Rus-M project in the fall of 2011, TsSKB Progress 
    announced that it was considering launching the Soyuz-1 rocket (then renamed 
    Soyuz-2-1v) from Baikonur and Vostochny launch site in addition to Plesetsk.<br>
    <b><br>
    Modifications</b><br>
    A main design feature differing Soyuz-1 from other rockets in the Soyuz family 
    would be the bottom section on the first (core) stage of the vehicle, accommodating 
    the NK-33-1 engine. Sporting larger diameter than in previous rockets, the section 
    could then migrate to the Soyuz-2-3 vehicle, if it was ever developed. Additionally, 
    Soyuz-1 would need four new attachments around the &quot;waist&quot; of its first stage, 
    which would be normally located at the tips of strap-on boosters. These devices 
    would interface with the tulip-like supports of the launch pad, holding the 
    rocket in place until the moment of a liftoff. Finally, in its tail section, 
    Soyuz-1 would need four connectors for guiding devices (UN) extending from the 
    launch pad, which would normally hold strap-on boosters. Respectively, on the 
    ground, below the launch pad, a downward looking cable umbilical and guiding 
    devices would have to be extended to reach much slimmer base of the Soyuz-1 
    rocket.<br>
    <b><br>
    Development</b><br>
    As of mid-2008, TsSKB was preparing to defend the preliminary design of the 
    vehicle in September 2008. <br>
    In the middle of 2010, TsSKB Progress representatives said that the manufacturing 
    of the test version of the Soyuz-1&#39;s core stage was underway. At the time, its 
    &quot;cold&quot; and live firings were planned as early as the end of that year.<br>
    In February 2011, Lt. General Oleg Ostapenko, a commander of the Russian space 
    forces, told Russian media that the first launch of Soyuz-2.1v (as Soyuz-1 became 
    known) could not take place during 2011, due to a lack of payloads.<br>
    In August 2011, the head of TsSKB Progress told Russian media that all design 
    documentation for the Soyuz-1 rocket had been completed and the production and 
    testing of its components had been underway.<br>
    On December 13, 2011, the first stage of the Soyuz-2-1v rocket arrived to NITs 
    RKP test center in Peresvet, north of Moscow in preparation for critical testing 
    of its propulsion system. As usual for the R-7 family of rockets, during the 
    transportation, the oversized core booster was split into two components: 2A, 
    comprised of a propulsion section and a kerosene tank and 1A - an oxygen tank. 
    Following the assembly of the stage, NITs RKP planned to conduct two &quot;cold&quot; 
    tests, KhSI, and one &quot;hot&quot; static firing of a flight ready booster, OSI, inside 
    a special test stand during 2012. The live firing test would be the last major 
    development milestone, clearing the vehicle for the first flight.<br>
    The test flight program of the Soyuz-1 rocket, involving five launches, was 
    to be completed in 2014.<br>
    <b><br>
    Development of a steering engine</b><br>
    In March 2010, Roskosmos announced that the RD-0110R engine developed by KBKhA 
    design bureau in Voronezh would steer the Soyuz-1 (Soyuz-2-1v) rocket during 
    the first stage of the flight. Four chambers of the RD-0110 engine have capability 
    to rotate in a single plane each, providing a three-axis stabilization. Via 
    its heat-exchanger system, the engine is also designed to heat up helium used 
    for pressurization of propellant tanks.<br>
    In 2000, RKK Energia, TsSKB Progress and KBKhA made a decision to use RD-0110R 
    on the second stage of the Avrora rocket, proposed for a never-developed launch 
    facility on Christmas Island, Australia. Based on a technical assignment from 
    TsSKB Progress, KBKhA issued a preliminary design for this steering engine, 
    closely based on the original RD-0110 engine. Modifications involved mostly 
    secondary components including: gimbal system, shortening of the combustion 
    chamber nozzles, supply lines for propellant and combustion chamber purging, 
    helium heat exchangers and exhaust nozzles. The aft bulkhead of the launch-vehicle&#39;s 
    tail section would be used as the attachment point for the combustion chambers, 
    turbopump, gas exhaust system and propellant supply lines.<br>
    According to Roskosmos, the production of the engine was in process of being 
    started at the adjacent Voronezh mechanical plant. The engine would have to 
    be modified to fit into the core stage, apparently requiring to increase distance 
    between four steering nozzles. Roskosmos promised first test firings of the 
    engine, based on the existing 11D55 powerplant in April-May 2010. On May 24, 
    2010, Viktor Gorokhov, a chief designer of the engine, was quoted as saying 
    that initial &quot;cold&quot; tests of the engine, involving flow of propellant without 
    its ignition, had been completed and after few more &quot;cold&quot; trials, a live firing 
    of RD-0110R would be conducted.<br>
    <b><br>
    Volga upper stage</b><br>
    Within the Soyuz-1 development project, TsSKB also proposed a Volga upper stage, 
    identified in official documentation as &quot;block vyvedeniya&quot; (insertion stage). 
    Serving as a second stage of the Soyuz-1, the Volga would deliver payload into 
    the final orbit during its mission lasting no more than 24 hours. Based on a 
    propulsion module of existing satellites developed at TsSKB Progress, Volga 
    was expected to have a price tag as much as four times cheaper than that of 
    the Fregat stage. A standard part of the Soyuz-1 rocket, Volga could also fly 
    on the Soyuz-2-1a rocket, replacing Fregat in up to half of expected missions.&quot;</font></td>
