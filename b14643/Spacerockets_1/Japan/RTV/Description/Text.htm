Testing (RVT) project was conducted by the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) from 1998 
until 2003. The project involved a series of experimental vehicles to test repeated 
flights of a reusable rocket. Four complete vehicles were developed during the project. 
The design of the experimental vehicles addressed various technical challenges for 
future Reusable Launch Vehicles (RLV) such as flight on demand, quick turnaround, 
higher performance, lightweight structures and materials.<br>
The project involved ground and flights tests with the flight testing conducted 
at the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) Noshiro Rocket Testing 
Center.<br>
The four vehicles developed during the project were assigned the designations RVT 
#1 to RVT #4. Each of the ground and flight test experiments was assigned a name 
from RVT-1 to RVT-14.<br>
<br>
JAXA proposes to develop a reusable high altitude rocket </font><b>
<font color="#FF0000">RTV</font></b><font color="#000080"> based on the technologies 
demonstrated in the RVT project. The rocket would take a payload of about 100 kg 
to an altitude of 100 km. RVT-derived equipment such as engines and attitude control 
will be used.<br>
For the propulsion of the RTV a new 40 kN thrust engine is to be developed, which 
is used in a cluster of four individual engines. However, it is not known whether 
the project will be realized.</font></p>
