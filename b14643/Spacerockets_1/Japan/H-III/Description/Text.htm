<font size="2" color="#000080"><b>TOKYO, 2014, January</b> -- The Japanese government 
has officially approved initial funding for a $1.9 billion effort to develop the 
H-3 rocket, the designated replacement for the country’s current H-IIA workhorse 
launcher.<br>
<br>
The H-3 rocket could be configured with zero, two, four or six strap-on solid rocket 
boosters to lift heavier payloads into orbit, according to JAXA&#39;s current design 
concepts. <br>
The basic configuration with no solid-fueled boosters could put up to 3 metric tons 
into a sun-synchronous orbit, a type of orbit often used by Earth imaging satellites.
<br>
The launcher&#39;s most powerful version, with six boosters, could put a 6.5 metric 
ton payload into geostationary transfer orbit, the drop-off point for communications 
satellites heading for operating positions 22,300 miles over the equator.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The H-3 will stand about 60 meters tall and have a core stage powered by a new liquid-hydrogen/liquid 
oxygen main engine dubbed LE-9 and anywhere from two to six solid-fueled strap-on 
boosters. The solid-fueled boosters will be based closely on the <b>M-34</b> second 
stage of Japan’s new Epsilon small rocket.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
A new hydrogen-fueled <b>LE-9</b> engine is in development for the first stage. 
Two of the engines, each generating about 300,000 pounds of thrust.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font size="2" color="#000080">The LE-9 engine features an open expander cycle, 
in which hydrogen from the engine turbopump is diverted to the main combustion chamber&#39;s 
cooling channels and then used to drive the turbines before being injected into 
the combustion flow at the nozzle extension, according to a technical document produced 
by JAXA engineers. <br>
Engineers say the open expander cycle, only used on upper stage engines up to now, 
allows the rocket engine to have a simpler design, reduces pressures and temperatures 
inside the engine, decreases heat on the turbines of the turbopump, and makes the 
engine more robust to failures.</font></p>
