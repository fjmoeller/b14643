(ALAC) was established as a successor to 1997 joint task group (Polyot Aviation 
Company and Khimautomatiki DB) to explore the possibilty of creating an air-launched 
system capable of placing satellites into LEO using the Antonov An-124 &quot;Ruslan&quot; 
as a flying launch pad.<br>
The Russian Air Launch Aerospace Corp. has given a commercial presentation of its 
commercial launch system, called Polyot,<b> </b>which will deliver 3.2 - 3.7 tons 
payloads into low Earth orbit after being dropped from a Antonov AN-124 transport 
plan. The rocket will be powered by an NK-43M (high-altitude version ) first stage 
engine.<br>
&nbsp;<u>The Air Launch System incorporates:</u><br>
&nbsp;Antonov An-124-100AL carrier aircraft (CA) as a flying launch pad;<br>
«Polyot» two-stage Launch Vehicle (LV) with modified LOX/Kerosene NK-43M first stage 
engine and RD-0124 second stage engine; modified RD-0158 LOX/Kerosene upper stage 
booster.<br>
The Air Launch Project development is carried out by top-level Russian aeronautical 
and rocket-and-space companies with the participation of the Ukrainian Antonov Aeronautical 
Scientific/Technical Complex (ASTC).<br>
<u>The Air Launch System major designers are:</u><br>
ASTC - development of aviation systems, including carrier aircraft (CA) and CA ground 
maintenance and preparation facilities;<br>
State Rocket Center «Academician V.P. Makeev Design Bureau» - development of LV 
systems, space systems and mission control center, including LV, USB and ground 
mission preparation and operation facilities;<br>
State Research &amp; Production Space Rocket Center «TsSKB-Progress» - development of 
the LV second stage (modified «I» booster of the LV «Soyuz-2»), and the LV «Polyot» 
manufacturing;<br>
Kuznetsov Scientific &amp; Engineering Center - NK-43 engine modification into NK-43M 
first stage sustainer;<br>
Khimautomatiki Design Bureau - RD-0124 engine adaptation to the LV «Polyot» second 
stage operating conditions, and development of RD-0158 engine for upper stage booster;<br>
NPO Automatics - development of the LV «Polyot» control system (based on the LV 
«Soyuz- 2» control system);<br>
KBTM - development of ground and airborne mission preparation and operation facilities. 
S.A. Lavochkin NPO, «Motorostroitel» JSC, Aviastar UAPK, «Novag» NTP, and other 
Russian rocket-and-space companies will also take part in the Project development.</font></p>

is planned. The project involves the launch of two-stage rockets with payloads of 
up to 3.5 tonnes from An-124-100 Ruslan heavy transport planes.<br>
The first stage of the rocket would use a NK-33MN engine. The second state will 
use a modified version of the engine, which has for a long time been used in the 
Block-DM unit produced by Energiya. Both engines use fuel - oxygen and kerosene.<br>
Vozdushny Start was sounded by the aviation concern Polyot (Voronezh), Energiya 
(Korolyov, Moscow region), Antonov Aviation Complex (Kiev), the Pilyugin Institute 
(Moscow) and Progress Rocket-Space Center (Samara).<br>
Air Launch corporation had formalized agreements between its major participants 
in the period of August 1999 to March 2000. The corporation declared itself &quot;ready 
for the job&quot; in July this year. Among its major members are Polyet airline, Korolyev&#39;s 
Energia Rocketry-space corporation (RKK Energia), ANTK Antonov, TsSKB-Samara and 
Pilugin&#39;s scientific-production center, KB Khimavtomatiki design bureau, Moscow 
Energy Institute, Aviastar factory, Nikolai Kuznetsov scientific-industrial complex, 
KBTM (Design bureau of transport machinery) and Motorostroitel. <br>
The Air Launch two-stage rocket booster shall be capable of placing a 3300 kg payload 
into low orbit with inclination of 63 degrees. The rocket will use well-tried components, 
such as the NK-33MN and 11D58M first and second stage engines respectively.<br>

or Unit 2&nbsp; (modified Proton upper stage with RD-58MFD engine) should serve 
as its second stage.</font></p>
