        Khimavtomatiki) to explore the possibility of creating an air-launched
        system capable of placing satellites into LEO using the Antonov An-124

        system, called Polyot,<strong> </strong>which will deliver 3.2–3.7 tonne
        payloads into Low Earth Orbit after being dropped from an Antonov An-124
        transport plane. The rocket will be powered by an NK-43M (high-altitude

        style="color:#FF0000;font-size:small;">Corporation</span><span
        style="color:#000080;font-size:small;"> is planned. The project involves
        the launch of two-stage rockets with payloads of up to 3.5 tonnes from
        An-124-100 Ruslan heavy transport planes.</span><br><span
        style="color:#000080;font-size:small;">The first stage of the rocket
        would use a NK-33MN engine. The second state will use a modified version
        of the engine, which has for a long time been used in the Block-DM unit
        produced by RKK Energia. Both engines use kerosene and liquid
        oxygen.</span><br><span style="color:#000080;font-size:small;">Vozdushny
        Start was founded by the Production Association Polyot (Voronezh), RKK
        Energia (Korolyov, Moscow region), Antonov Aviation Complex (Kyiv), the

        (Samara).</span><br><span style="color:#000080;font-size:small;">Air
        Launch Corporation had formalized agreements between its major
        participants in the period from August 1999 to March 2000. The
        corporation declared itself "ready for the job" in July of that year.
        Among its major members are Polet Airlines, Korolev's Rocket and Space
        Corporation “Energia” (RKK Energia), ANTK Antonov, TsSKB-Progress
        (Samara) and Pilugin's scientific-production center, KB Khimavtomatiki,
        Moscow Energy Institute, Aviastar factory, Nikolai Kuznetsov Design
        Bureau, KBTM (TransMash Design Bureau) and JSC
        Motorostroitel.&nbsp;</span><br><span
        style="color:#000080;font-size:small;">The Air Launch two-stage rocket
        booster should be capable of placing a 3300 kg payload into low orbit
        with an inclination of 63 degrees. The rocket will use well-tried
        components, such as the NK-33MN and 11D58M first and second stage
        engines respectively.</span><br><span

        Progress</span><span style="color:#000080;font-size:small;"> to develop
        an Air Launch aircraft-rocket system was a turning point in the life of
        the Yamal family. The corporation got an about 40% stake in Air Launch.
        In the framework of the project, a two-stage Polyot</span><span
        style="color:#FF0000;font-size:small;"> </span><span
        style="color:#000080;font-size:small;">should be developed to be
        launched from the An-124-100 Ruslan aircraft. The first stage (Block 1)
        will have one NK-33MN engine. Compared to NK-33M, its thrust should rise
        from 188 to 196 tonnes-force. The Yamal stage or Block 2 (modified
        Proton upper stage with RD-58MFD engine) should serve as its second
        stage.</span></p>
