</font><font color="#000080" size="2">The UNITY Launch Vehicle Project is being 
developed to service satellite orbital placement and is structured specifically 
to deal with the launch requirements of the LEO satellite market.<br>
The launch vehicle family is designated as UNITY. The first vehicle being developed 
is the </font><font color="#FF0000" size="2">ULV-22</font><font color="#000080" size="2">. 
It follows the traditional proven Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle design with 
two main stages, plus a post-boost low thrust stage to enable maximum required performance 
and precise injection of the satellites into their required orbits. The ULV-22 is 
capable of placing 5 tons of payload into a 200-kilometre orbit.<br>
The launch vehicle is designed by the State Rocket Centre (SRC) formerly known as 
Makeev Design Bureau.<br>
UNITY will incorporate three liquid fuelled oxygen and kerosene high thrust RD-120U 
engines manufactured by the world leading NPO Energomash for the first stage booster, 
and one RD-0136 four-chamber engine manufactured by Chemical Automatics Design Bureau 
of Voronezh for the second stage.<br>
The Design Bureau of Transport Machinery, is the leading designer for the Ground 
Launch Equipment and Complex. Equipment is being incorporated by SRC from other 
eminent aerospace companies who have a proven track record with successful space 
programmes.<br>

International </font><font size="2" color="#000080">(ULSI) on the design of a new 
SLV, subsequently named </font><font size="2" color="#FF0000">ULV-22 Yedinstvo (Unity)</font><font size="2" color="#000080">, 
designed to launch satellites into low and medium orbits, and developing a space 
launch facility on Hammock Hill Island of the coast of Australia. The project stalled 
due to ULSI&#39;s inability to attract investors. In 2001 the Makeyev center announced 
that it completed the development of a demonstration example of the Yedinstvo SLV. 
The center has also delivered draft plans for the Yedinstvo SLV and similarly named 
space launch complex to ULSI. Should funding materialize, Yedinstvo will be built 
at the Progress plant in Samara, part of the State Space-Missile Center SKB-Progress, 
at a rate of up to 10 SLVs per year. Engines for the first stage were developed 
by NPO Energomash in Khimki on the basis of engines used in the second stage of 
the Zenit SLV. Other firms involved in the project include NII Khimavtomatiki in 
Voronezh (second stage engines), Nizhnaya Salda-based NII Mashinostroyeniya (low-thrust 
rocket engines), and KB Transportnogo Mashinostroyeniya. Foreign companies involved 
in the project included Boeing and Motorola.<br>

<b>Russian rockets to be launched from Australia</b><br>
A vital phase in the establishment of a new space launch site for Russian launch 
vehicles in Australia ended as the State Missile Centre (SMC) - the Academician 
Makeyev Design Bureau of Miass (Chelyabinskaya Oblast, Russia) – successfully delivered 
to the representatives of the United Launch Systems International (ULSI) a preliminary 
design package for the future Yedinstvo (Unity) launch System project, which includes 
construction of a space launch site in Australia to launch the Russian ULV-22 Unity 
Launch Vehicle.<br>
The Makeyev Design Bureau has been working closely with the ULSI since 1995. It 
took Makeyev a year to develop a preliminary design for the Unity Launch System 
under a contract with ULSI. Today, ULSI have obtained all space launch site construction 
permits from the Government of Australia and the governments of the concerned&nbsp; 
States of the Commonwealth; a relevant decree of the Government of Russia is anticipated 
soon.<br>
The ULV-22 launch vehicle is a tandem two-stage rocket with an upper stage. The 
propellants are environment-friendly kerosene and liquid oxygen. The upper stage 
propellants are ethyl alcohol and oxygen.<br>
LV stages will be manufactured and assembled at the Progress Plant of the TsSKB 
Design Bureau in Samara. The 202 t launch mass, two-stage ULV-22 with an upper stage 
is designed for indivudial or miltiple injection of commercial spacecraft into variously 
inclined low- or medium-altitude Earth orbits. LV can put at least 5.0 t payload 
into a low Earth orbit.<br>
The first stage engine developed in Khimki by NPO Energomash is based on the RD-120 
engine design used in the second stage of the Zenit launcher. The first stage steering 
chambers have been borrowed from the RD-107 engine used in the Soyuz first stage. 
Second stage engines indexed RD-0136 are being developed by the Voronezh Chemical 
Automatics Design Bureau (KB KhA) on the basis of RD-0124 engine designed for the 
third stage of Soyuz launch vehicle. The low-thrust, restartable upper stage engines 
are developed by the Engineering Science Research Institute of Nizhnyaya Salda on 
the basis of the 17D16 engine originally intended for the Buran space shuttle.<br>
<b>Launch Site<br>
</b>The proposed space launch site is to be located on Hammock Hill Island near 
Australia&#39;s east coast. The location of the island is very convenient, as there 
is only a fifty-meter-wide strait that separates Hammock Hill from the mainland. 
The co-ordinates of the proposed launch site are: 24° latitude south, 152° longitude 
east.</font></p>
