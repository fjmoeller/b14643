    missile. The first stage was adopted largely unchanged. The <font color="#FF0000">Kosmos 3M</font> (11K65M) 
    first stage uses the RD-216M (NPO Energomash 11D614) engine; a bundle of two dual-chamber
    RD-215M engines. It achieves a ground thrust of 1,480 kN.<br>The second stage (S-3) was a new development. The
    Khimmash DU-49 engine (S5.23, 11D49) consists of a single-chamber cruise engine and four Vernier control
    nozzles. The cruise engine is reignitable and develops a total thrust of 157.5 kN (vac). The control nozzles
    develop a total thrust of 5.6&ndash;7.1 kN (Isp = 1726 N*s/kg) and are supplied by four cylindrical fuel tanks
    attached to the outside of the second stage.</p>
    <p>Both stages are initially operated with the fuel combination UDMH and AK-27I, AK-27I is a mixture of nitric
    acid with 27% nitrogen tetroxide.</p>
    <p>The fuel tanks of the second stage S-3 are made in integral construction. The engine is suspended without a frame.</p>
    <p>The entire launch vehicle is 32.42 m high, of which the fairing has a diameter of 2.44 m and a length of 5.72 m.</p>
    <p>The maiden flight with three dummy satellites of the Strela 1 type (Kosmos 38,39,40) took place on August 18,
    1964. By 1968, 11 more orbital launches had been made from Baikonur, with three losses.<br>In 1967, operations
    began from Plesetsk in northern Russia with the series version <font color="#FF0000">Kosmos 3M</font>. It has an improved second stage S-3M. This version is
    still in use today and has been built by AKO Polyot in Omsk since 1968. The payloads included electronic
    reconnaissance satellites of the Tselina-O type, navigation satellites of the Tayfun, Parus, Cikada, Nadezhda
    types, military communications satellites of the Strela type, radar calibration satellites Vector, Yug, Romb and
    scientific satellites of the AUOS type.</p>
    <p>Since 1973, the Kapustin Yar launch complex has also been used again for orbital launches.
    <br>The <font color="#FF0000">Kosmos 3M-RB</font> variant was used to transport the space shuttle
    models Bor 4 and 5 into suborbital and low-earth orbits. In the 1970s, the Kosmos 3M from Kapustin Yar and Plesetsk,
    and later from Plesetsk, also carried several foreign and Interkosmos satellites into orbit.</p></font></td>

    <font color="#FF0000"><b>Kosmos 3</b> </font><font color="#000000">is a small, 
    two-stage, liquid-fueled launch vehicle that has been used to launch Soviet 
    and Russian light military payloads. Both stages are cylindrical and carry storable 
    liquid propellants UDMH / AK-27I (Nitric Acid + 27% N2O4). The first stage consists 
    of an interstage, two propellant tanks, an intertank compartment, and a tail 
    compartment that contains the propulsion system.The tanks are made of welded 
    aluminium with a minimum thickness of&nbsp; 2.25 mm. The oxidiser feed line 
    passes through the middle of the fuel tank. The tail compartment is slightly 
    conical, with a maximum diameter of&nbsp; 2.85 m, at its base. Small aerodynamic 
    fins bring the total span to 4.40 m. The first-stage propulsion system is designated 
    the RD-216 and consists of two sets of turbopumps and four thrust chambers.<br>
    The&nbsp; second stage configuration is similar to the first stage. A tail compartment 
    contains the propulsion system. The propellant is housed in two cylindrical 
    tanks with a common bulkhead, and the oxidiser feed line runs through the middle 
    of the fuel tank. The cylindrical instrumentation compartment is located above 
    the tanks. For missions to higher orbits a pair of long thin propellant tanks 
    is attached to the outside of the second stage. These tanks carry the propellant 
    for the ACS system and for the second burn of the main engine DU49 (S5.23), 
    which lasts only 2-8 sec.<br>
    The Kosmos 3M is the operational version and has been in use since 1967. Kosmos&nbsp; 
    has had a very high flight ate, with more than 500 orbital launches. Kosmos 
    is launched from Plesetzk, Tyuratam and Kapustin Jar.<br>
    Kosmos 3M was manufactured by PO Polyot of Omsk, Russia. Production has stopped. 
    Production could be restarted for an order of five or more vehicles.<br>
    </font></font><font color="#000000" size="2">
    Until 1993 the smallest Russian launch vehicle in use was the &quot;Kosmos-3M&quot; booster, 
    derived from the R-14 (NATO designator SS-5) medium range ballistic missile. 
    Originally designed by the &quot;Yangel Design Bureau&quot; in Ukraine (now the NPO &quot;Yuzhnoye&quot;) 
    and the &quot;Applied Mechanics Scientific Production Association&quot; in Russia, the 
    &quot;Kosmos-3M&quot; has been manufactured by the NPO &quot;Polet&quot; in Omsk, Russia, for nearly 
    30 years. More than 430 &quot;Kosmos-3M&quot; produced since 1964. The&nbsp; &quot;Kosmos-3M&quot; 
    booster consisted of an&nbsp; R-14 first stage and a restartable second stage. 
    It was first used to launch &quot;Kosmos 38-40&quot; and it replaced the &quot;Kosmos-2&quot; by 
    1977. The first stage had two RD-216 engines, each with two combustion chambers, 
    that burned UDMH/AK-27&nbsp; producing 176,000 kg thrust. The first stage was 
    21.5 meters long, and the second stage was 6.5 meters long. The standard launch 
    shroud brought total length to 32.4 meters, and diameter was 2.5 meters.&nbsp; 
    The&nbsp; &quot;Kosmos-3M&quot; was used to launch the Soviet anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon 
    test flights in the 1970s. The &quot;Kosmos-3M&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; also launched the BOR 
    space plane tests of the 1980s which were related to the development of the 
    Soviet space shuttle. The first launch from Plesetsk was on May 15, 1967 (&quot;Kosmos 
    158&quot;). Launch weight is 109 t. Until 1 January 1996,&nbsp; 389 (366 successful)&nbsp; 
    launches&nbsp; was made&nbsp; from Plesetsk. The two-stage booster burns UDMH 
    as a fuel and Nitric Acid + N2O4 as the oxidizer. The first stage employs two 
    11 D614 (RD-216) main engines, while the second stage relies on a single, restartable 
    11D49 main engine. The second stage also carries an independent propulsion system 
    for coast and spacecraft deployment operations. Used only for LEO missions, 
    the &quot;Kosmos-3M&quot; has a demonstrated payload capacity of 1,500 kg to a low altitude, 
    51 degree-inclination parking orbit.</font></p>

</font><font size="2" color="#000000">The <b>first stage</b> consists of tail compartment, 
load-bearing ring, fuel tank, instrumentation compartment, oxidizer tank, and interstage 
section.<br>
First stage engine, fuel-supply system components and sub-assemblies are placed 
in the tail compartment, which take launch and flight loads. This compartment is 
a conical thin-walled reinforced by structural rings and stringers. It is a non-pressurized 
structure.<br>
The tail compartment has four support brackets to install LV on launch pad and four 
fixed air fins. The support brackets are equipped with swivel gas-jet vanes to steer 
LV in flight. Tail compartment body has three rows of flight and non-flight doors 
closed by removable covers.<br>
On top of the tail compartment the load-bearing ring is bolted for the uniform distribution 
of engine thrust to the LV thin-walled case.<br>
The oxidizer and fuel tanks are load-bearing structure with pressed panels and two 
forged bottoms of the spherical shape and are intended for propellant components. 
They are made of aluminum-magnesium alloy.<br>
The instrumentation compartment is placed between the fuel and oxidizer tanks. It 
houses guidance and control system and telemetry instruments required for first 
Stage system operation. The instrumentation compartment is riveted cylindrical structure 
reinforced by load-bearing rings and stringers. Access to instruments placed on 
panel inside the compartment is provided through four doors in instrumentation compartment 
casing which are closed by removable covers.<br>
On the compartment body two solid rocket motors are installed which serve to decelerate 
first Stage during separation from second Stage. The instrumentation compartment 
is bolted with the end rings of the fuel and oxidizer tanks through the load-bearing 
rings.<br>
The interstage section is intended for second Stage engine location and for stage 
integration. It is mounted to the upper ring of the oxidizer tank. This section 
is riveted structure reinforced by load-bearing rings and stringers.<br>
The interstage section has two rows of doors: lower and upper ones. The upper doors 
provide access to engine units, and the lower doors are intended for gas exhaust 
from the second Stage engine steering nozzles, beginning from their starting up 
to the first Stage/second Stage separation.<br>
Along first Stage body (except for tail compartment) between stabilization planes 
III and IV the channel is laid for onboard LV cables and pneumatic-hydraulic pipelines. 
The interstage section is attached by its upper ring to the second Stage using four 
explosive bolts.<br>
Second Stage consists of a tail compartment, propellant compartment, instrumentation 
compartment, and spacecraft mounting frame.<br>
The tail compartment is a riveted cylindrical structure and is intended for first 
Stage/ second Stage integration. It houses steering nozzles with feeding pipelines 
and steering actuators. On the tail compartment for access to the steering actuators 
there are four doors which are closed by covers.<br>
The <b>second Stage</b> propellant compartment is a load-bearing structure and is 
made as welded cylindrical section with three bottoms. The intermediate spherical 
bottom separates this compartment into two enclosures: upper enclosure for oxidizer 
and lower cavity for fuel. The conic lower bottom has reinforced flange on which 
sustainer engine is mounted by studs. Casing, bottoms and rings of the propellant 
compartment are made of aluminum-magnesium alloy.<br>
The second Stage instrumentation compartment is intended for spacecraft mounting 
frame (SC adapter) location. SC adapter design is assembly of upper ring and supporting 
pillars.<br>
<br>
Spacecraft is installed on the SC adapter upper ring, and guidance and telemetry 
instruments are mounted on the supporting pillars. The fairing is attached to the 
instrumentation compartment upper ring.<br>
The low-thrust propulsion system tanks provide oxidizer and fuel feeding to the 
low-thrust propulsion system (LTPS) at transfer orbit and to the second Stage engine 
during the second burn. These tanks are placed at 45 degrees angle to the I-IV and 
II-III stabilization planes. They are two sets of tanks each consisting of a fuel 
and oxidizer tanks connected by adapter.<br>
LV flight trajectory at powered flight is determined with allowance for the assigned 
areas for the 1st Stage spent elements and fairing flaps.<br>
Injection into orbits with inclination of 51&deg;, 66&deg;, 74&deg;, 83&deg; and 87.3&deg; is performed 
using standard control programs providing SC energy-optimal injection into near-circular 
orbit with altitude up to 1700 km. In this case the 1st Stage/2nd Stage separation 
is performed at 58 km altitude, and the fairing flaps are released at 75 km altitude.<br>
If a heat flow affecting the spacecraft should be reduced, new trajectories can 
be determined which allow to increase an altitude of the fairing flaps jettison 
up to values that provide the allowable heat flow. However this requires the development 
of new control program, modernization of LV GCS instruments and assigning of new 
impact areas, that result in deterioration of LV capabilities.<br>
LV flight sequence begins from the 1st Stage ignition. Prior to the 1st Stage shutdown, 
the steering nozzles and main engine of the 2nd Stage are ignited sequentially. 
During the 2nd Stage flight, after the LV passed the highair drag zone, the fairing 
is released.<br>
When the prescribed trajectory parameters are achieved, the 2nd Stage is burned 
and the LV is entered a transfer orbit.<br>
The 2nd Stage is shut down by sequential shutdown of the steering nozzles and main 
engine.<br>
After the steering nozzles shut down, the low-thrust propulsion system nozzles are 
ignited and they perform the LV guidance and stabilization during flight in transfer 
orbit. In a predicted point of transfer orbit, the required trajectory parameters 
are achieved by the 2nd Stage second ignition that provides the LV insertion into 
the prescribed operational orbit.<br>
Within 20 seconds after the 2nd Stage shut down, spacecraft is separated from LV. 
Within 1.25 seconds after the spacecraft separation, the solid rocket motor in the 
2nd Stage tail compartment is ignited. This motor provides a turn of this Stage 
and avoidance maneuver is performed.</font></p>
