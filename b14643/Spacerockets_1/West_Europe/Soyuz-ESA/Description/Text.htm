<p><font color="#000080" size="2">PARIS — The European version of Russia’s Soyuz 
rocket has successfully completed a simulated launch campaign at Europe’s Guiana 
Space Center spaceport and its operations were formally transferred to the Arianespace 
commercial launch consortium, the European Space Agency (ESA) and Arianespace announced.
<br>
<br>
Evry, France-based Arianespace also announced that the inaugural flight of Europe’s 
Soyuz has slipped again, to October 2011. The flight will carry two Galileo positioning, 
navigation and timing satellites. Development of these spacecraft, and of two others 
that make up Galileo’s four-satellite In-Orbit Validation system, has taken far 
longer than expected following a series of obstacles encountered by the prime contractors, 
Thales Alenia Space and Astrium Satellites, both of Europe. <br>
<br>
Arianespace officials had hoped to squeeze in a commercial Soyuz launch this summer, 
especially since the Soyuz launch pad and the vehicle itself are ready to go. But 
more recently the company, together with European governments, decided to wait for 
the Galileo satellites. <br>
The dry run, conducted from April 29 to May 5, included a simulated liftoff of the 
Soyuz carrying a 2,570-kilogram telecommunications satellite into geostationary 
transfer orbit after a 30-minute flight. Equipped with a Fregat upper stage, the 
Europeanized Soyuz is capable of carrying telecommunications satellites weighing 
up to 3,000 kilograms into that orbit, which is the principal drop-off point for 
telecommunications satellites. <br>
Vehicles loaded with Soyuz fuel were deployed to the site as part of the exercise, 
but the rocket was not actually filled with fuel. <br>
Soyuz will complement the heavy-lift Ariane 5 rocket and ESA’s future Vega small-satellite 
launcher, which like Soyuz is expected to make its inaugural flight, from a separate 
launch pad, late this year. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" color="#000080">The Soyuz 2 launcher, a new version of the Soyuz 
launcher is nearing the end of the development phase. It offers 2 versions of an 
improved 3-stage Soyuz-2 (2.1a and 2.1b), the FREGAT stage and a new fairing made 
of composite, 4.11 m in diameter and 11.4 m long.<br>
Adaptation of the launcher for the CSG (Soyuz STK)<br>
With its proven reliability in flight, the Soyuz launcher will be used from the 
CSG with as few changes as possible. The approach chosen for the development programme 
is rather to adapt the new launch base to the launch vehicle.<br>
This launcher, derived from Soyuz-2, should nevertheless be adapted slightly to 
enable it to be launched from the CSG. This new version, called </font>
<font size="2" color="#FF0000"><b>Soyuz STK</b></font><font size="2" color="#000080">&nbsp; 
(STK-A for the 3-stage 2.1a version) will include in particular :<br>
<br>
• the parameters for the new trajectories from French Guiana (location of the launch 
pad and changes to the flight software,<br>
• resistance to the natural environment of French Guiana,<br>
• a telemetry system which is compatible with the frequencies used and the network 
of CSG stations,<br>
• a system for neutralising the launcher to comply with CSG range safety regulations 
and changes to the flight software of the 3-stage version<br>
&nbsp;and the Fregat. <br>
