(INTA) announced plans to develop a small orbital launch vehicle. INTA apparently 
acquired materials and technology from Argentina&#39;s <b>Condor-II</b> missile project, 
which was cancelled in 1990. Of particular interest were steerable nozzles and the 
solid propellant fuel.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" color="#000080">The Capricornio is a three-stage 
solid propellant launcher designed to carry 60-140 kg payloads into low earth orbit 
(LEO). It has an overall length of 18.25 m, a principal body diameter of 1.0 m and 
weighs 15,035 kg at launch. <br>
Stage 1 is 8.99 m long and has a body diameter of 1.02 m. It contains a Thiokol
<b>Castor 4B</b> motor with HTPB solid propellant, which has a burn time of 61 sec 
and an average thrust of 429 kN . Attitude control is by TVC and roll control by 
the automatic control system (ACS) situated above the third stage.<br>
Stage 2, designated <b>DENEB-F</b>, is 3.0 m long, has a body diameter of 0.83 m 
and weighs 2,549 kg. The motor, which weighs 2,436 kg, contains 2,124 kg of solid 
propellant, has a burn time of 35.6 seconds and an average thrust of 167.9 kN. Attitude 
control in pitch and yaw is by nozzle TVC, and roll control by stage 3 ACS.<br>
Stage 3, designated <b>Mizar-B</b>, is 2.1 m long, has a body diameter of 0.83 m 
and weighs 717 kg. The motor, which weighs 686 kg, contains 607 kg of solid propellant, 
has a burn time of 33.8 seconds and an average thrust of 50.29 kN. Attitude control 
is unknown.<br>
<br>
In 1999 it was reported that the first flight of Capricornio is scheduled to take 
place from the Canary Island site in late 1999 or 2000.&quot;<br>
Spacial Base in the Canary Islands canceled in 1999 due to protests. Capricornio 
cancelled in the final phase.</font></p>
