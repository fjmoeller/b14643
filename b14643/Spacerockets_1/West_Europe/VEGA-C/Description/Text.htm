<font color="#FF0000">Vega-C</font></b><font color="#000080"> is based on the existing 
Vega launch vehicle. It comprises four stages: three solid propellant stages, an 
upper fourth stage powered by a reignitable liquid-propellant engine, and a payload 
fairing.<br>
The ogive-shaped <b>fairing</b> at the top of Vega-C is 3.3 m in diameter and over 
9 m tall.&nbsp; Made of carbon fibre-polymer composite and ‘cured’ in an industrial 
oven, this structure protects satellites from the thermal, acoustic, and aerodynamic 
stresses at liftoff and on the ascent to space. <br>
<b>The upper stage</b> AVUM+, or Attitude Vernier Upper Module, ensures attitude 
control and precise orbital positioning and is designed for extended stays in space. 
The AVUM+ has a propellant mass of 0.74 t and the main engine will provide an average 
thrust of 2.45 kN. The reignition capability of the AVUM+ allows Vega-C to reach 
a range of orbits to deliver multiple payloads on a single mission. Thrusters will 
typically burn one, two or more times to reach the required orbits. After separation 
of the payload(s), there will be a final boost to deorbit the upper stage, so that 
it burns up high in Earth&#39;s atmosphere over the ocean.<br>
<b>The third stage</b> Zefiro-9, derived from Vega, burns 10 t of solid propellant.<br>
<b>The second stage</b> powered by the new Zefiro-40 (Z40) motor contains about 
36 t of solid propellant, providing an average thrust of 1100 kN.<br>
<b>The first stage</b> P120C motor is one of the largest monolithic carbon-fibre 
solid-propellant rocket motors ever built in one piece. Its development relies on 
new technologies derived from those of P80, the current first stage motor of Vega, 
to provide a significant increase in thrust at liftoff. The P120C will also be used 
as the side boosters on the Ariane 6 rocket, creating an opportunity for Europe 
to scale up production by using it on two launch vehicles in parallel.</font><br>
<font color="#FF0000"><b>Vega-E</b></font><font color="#000080"> will have three 
stages unlike Vega-C which has four. Two stages will be derived from Vega-C: the 
first stage P120C solid rocket motor which provides the thrust at liftoff and the 
second stage solid rocket Zefiro-40 motor. The new third stage is the liquid oxygen–methane 
cryogenic upper stage which is the core of Vega-E preparation.<br>
Vega-E’s upper stage will replace the third stage Zefiro 9 solid-propellant motor 
and the fourth stage upper AVUM of the current Vega configuration.<br>
Vega-E’s upper stage will improve mission flexibility through its new </font><b>

<font color="#FF0000">Vega-C</font></b> is expected to debut in mid-2019, increasing 
performance from Vega’s current 1.5 t to about 2.2 t in a reference 700 km polar 
orbit, covering identified European institutional users’ mission needs, with no 
increase in launch service and operating costs. <br>
The first stage is based on the P120C, the largest monolithic carbon fibre solid-propellant 
rocket motor ever built. Its development relies on new technologies derived from 
those of P80, Vega’s current first stage motor and will provide a significant increase 
in performance. The P120C will also be used for the liftoff boosters on Ariane 6.
<br>
The second stage with the new Zefiro-40 (Z40) motor will contain about 36 t of solid 
propellant providing an average thrust of 1100 kN. The Zefiro-9 third stage, currently 
used on Vega, burns 10 t of solid propellant. <br>
The AVUM+ upper stage for orbital positioning and attitude control is derived from 
the current Vega AVUM but has a lighter structure. It carries more propellant inside 
larger tanks and features several new European-developed components. AVUM+ has a 
propellant mass of 0.74 t and the main engine will provide an average thrust of 
2.45 kN. <br>
A larger fairing with an increased payload envelope (diameter 3 m) to accommodate 
larger satellites is also being developed. It will be suitable for Earth observation 
satellites of more than two tonnes, and the Space Rider reentry vehicle. <br>
The total length of Vega-C is about 35 m with a mass at liftoff of 210 t – a significant 
increase over the current Vega’s 130 t. Vega-C will be launched from the same site 
used for Vega at Europe’s Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. <br>
Preparatory activities are under way for the evolution of Vega (<b><font color="#FF0000">Vega-E</font></b>) 
beyond 2025 into a family of configurations. These will be based on existing building 
blocks and those under development (P120C, P80, Z23, Z40, Z9, AVUM, VUS) capable 
of improving the system’s competitiveness for the normal Vega-C payload class and 
in the small–satellite market. <br>
The main element of this evolution is a new European cryogenic upper stage powered 
by a 10 t-class liquid oxygen and methane expander cycle engine. This would replace 
the current Zefiro-9 and AVUM. <br>
