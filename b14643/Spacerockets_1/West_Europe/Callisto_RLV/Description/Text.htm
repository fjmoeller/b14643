    <td width="72%"><font color="#000080">ESA and ArianeGroup now signed a contract 
    to develop a full-scale Callisto demonstrator to be ground tested in November 
    2020.<br>
    Callisto its progress is somewhat separate from <u><i>Prometheus Methane/LOX engine</i></u>. 
    Callisto will need to launch with a different engine because it will be too 
    small for the new Prometheus engine, and also because Prometheus will not be 
    ready to fly on Callisto in 2020.<br>
    As the project matures, larger versions would 
    fly that could then potentially use Prometheus.<br>
    The Callisto vehicle is a single stage vehicle equipped with a </font>
    <font color="#FF0000">40 kN class LOX/LH2 engine*)</font><font color="#000080">, 
    with thrust modulation capability of 40%. The main mission objective is to be 
    able to perform a so-called “Tossback” flight profile, which includes in particular:<br>
    - A classical ascent phase<br>
    - A “ballistic” attitude change phase, so-called “tilt-over”<br>
    - A “boostback” flight phase which aims at targeting the landing site<br>
    - A guided reentry phase<br>
    - A final boost which enables to reach touchdown conditions compatible with 
    the vehicle design<br>
    <font size="2"><br>
    </font>Preliminary design studies showed that vehicle diameter has a major impact 
    on performance, and shall result from extensive trade-off between accommodation 
    (propulsion subsystem in particular) and mass.<br>
    The reference vehicle has a diameter of around 1 m, with a total height around 
    13.5 m. It is equipped with two main external features compared to a classical 
    operational launcher:<br>
    Deployable fins, which are folded during ascent and are unfolded during the 
    ballistic phase before reentry : they enable to stabilize and control the vehicle 
    during its atmospheric entry.<br>
    Four landing legs, which are also folded during ascent and deployed very shortly 
    before landing. A preliminary design has been done with the objective of ensuring 
    both sufficient engine clearance with respect to ground and stability at touchdown.</font><p>
