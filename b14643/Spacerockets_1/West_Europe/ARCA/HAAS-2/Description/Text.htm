    orbital rocket.<br>
    HAAS-2 will be launched from the ground and will have as objective the flight 
    testing of the Executor engine and to reach orbit. The mission will also be 
    a final test for the Moon launch of the European Lunar Explorer space probe, 
    in the Google Lunar X Prize american competition.<br>
    The HAAS-2 rocket will be one stage launched, being for the first time when 
    is attempted to launch a satellite by a one stage rocket. This is possible because 
    of the rocket tanks&#39; construction technology of composite materials that are 
    very light.<br>
    <br>
    <b>ARCA </b>and<b> SIAD Romania</b> became partners in the Romanian Space Program.<br>
    SIAD Romania will provide over the coming years liquid oxygen for the Executor 
    rocket engine, the &quot;heart&quot; of the entire ARCA Space Program. SIAD Romania will 
    also provide ARCA with liquid oxygen systems and with the expertise required 
    to deploy and operate these facilities.<br>
    Liquid oxygen, a cryogenic gas, with a working temerature on board the tanks 
    made by ARCA of - 180° C, is used with kerosene to fuel the rocket engine. Kerosene 
    burns inside the engine, in an oxygen environment, with the temperature reaching 
    values above 3000° C, the resulting gases allowing the engine to provide a traction 
    of 24 tons.<br>
    SIAD Romania is not only a supplier of industrial gases and technologies, but 
    also an active and consistent participant with its partners in various projects 
    and new applications. Therefore, we are very glad that ARCA has given us the 
    opportunity to participate in the Romanian Space Program.</font></p>

    <b>HAAS-2C</b> is an orbital rocket intended for commercial payload launches. 
    There are two variants of the rocket, a single stage to orbit variant capable 
    of placing a 50 kg payload into orbit and a two stage variant capable of lifting 
    a 400 kg payload into orbit. After testing the extremely lightwight composite 
    tank, ARCA designed a single stage 18m long rocket with a total weight of 510 
    kg, having a thrust to weight ratio of 26:1 and a 50 kg payload. They presented 
    the rocket in Victoria Square in Bucharest, in front of the Romanian Government 
    building. The second stage version will be powered by the Executor engine for 
    the lower stage and the upper stage will use a smaller engine adapted for vacuum, 
    named Venator.<br>

    order to reach the objectives, the team decided to use composite materials and 
    aluminum alloys on a large scale. The composite materials offer low construction 
    costs and a reduced weight of the components. <br>
    Composite materials were used in the construction of the combustion chamber 
    and the nozzle, and also the gas generator and some elements in the turbopumps.
    <br>
    The combustion chamber and the nozzle are built from two layers. The internal 
    layer is made of silica fiber and phenolic resin, and the external one is made 
    of cabon fiber and epoxy resin.The phenolic resin reinforced with silica fiber 
    pirolizes endothermally in the combustion chamber walls, releasing gases like 
    oxygen and hydrogen, leaving a local carbon matrix. The gases spread through 
    the carbon matrix and reach the internal surface of the wall where they meet 
    the hot combustion gases and act as a cooling agent. Furthermore, the engine 
    is equipped with a cooling system that injects on the internal walls 10 percent 
    of the total kerosene mass.<br>
    The gas generator has the same cooling principle and also the intake and exhaust 
    turbine volutes, that are constructed from the same composite materials mentioned 
    above.<br>
    Using these light materials makes the Executor engine to have a thrust/mass 
    ratio of 110. The most performant European engines used for Ariane and Vega 
    launchers do not reach a ratio of 100.<br>
    The pump volutes are made of 6062 type aluminum alloy. The pump rotors are made 
    through lathing and milling using 304 type steel. The supersonic turbine is 
    made of refractory steel, both the core and the blades. The turbine rotation 
    speed is 20.000 rpm and has a 1,5 MW power. The intake gas temperature is 620 
    degrees Celsius.<br>
    The main engine valves are made of 6060 type aluminum and are pneumatically 
    powered, without adjustement. The gas generator valves are ball typed, pneumatically 
    powered and can be adjusted, being one of the few elements not entirely made 
    at ARCA.<br>
    The engine injector and the liquid oxygen intake pipes are made of 304 L type 
    steel and the kerosene intake pipe is made of composite materials.<br>
    The engine has the posibility to direct the thrust by 5 degrees on two axis. 
    The articulated system is made of composite materials and high grade steel alloy. 
    The engine is rotated using two hydraulic pistons that use kerosene from the 
    pump exhaust system. The hydraulic pistons are made of steel and are made entirely 
    at ARCA.</font></p>

    The <b>Venator</b> Rocket Engine (VRE) will be used to power the second stage 
    of the HAAS-2C rocket.<br>
    Venator is pressure feed rocket engine, that uses liquid oxygen and kerosene 
    and has a maximum thrust of 2.5 tons of thrust.<br>
    The main objectives for this engine were low development and construction costs, 
    without sacrificing the high performance. <br>
    In order to reach the objectives, the team decided to use composite materials 
    and aluminum alloys. Excepting the injection head and liquid oxygen pipe, almost 
    all engine components are made of composites. The composite materials offer 
    low construction costs and a reduced weight of the components. <br>
    The combustion chamber and the nozzle are built from two layers. The internal 
    layer is made of silica fiber and phenolic resin, and the external one is made 
    of carbon fiber and epoxy resin.The phenolic resin reinforced with silica fiber 
    pirolizes endothermally in the combustion chamber walls, releasing gases like 
    oxygen and hydrogen, leaving a local carbon matrix. The gases spread through 
    the carbon matrix and reach the internal surface of the wall where they meet 
    the hot combustion gases and act as a cooling agent. Furthermore, the engine 
    is equipped with a cooling system that injects on the internal walls 10 percent 
    of the total kerosene mass.<br>
    The Venator rocket engine has no vanes on the main pipes. It uses instead burst 
    disks on the main pipes, between the tanks and the engine. The second stage 
    is pressurized at 2 atm at lift-off and after the first stage burn-out, the 
    second stage will be pressurized at 16 atm. At that pressure the disks will 
    burst and the fuel will flow through the engine. Using burst disks, the mass 
    of the stage will decrease while the reliability will increase. <br>
    The pump volutes are made of 6062 type aluminum alloy. The pump rotors are made 
    through lathing and milling using 304 type steel. The supersonic turbine is 
    made of refractory steel, both the core and the blades. The turbine rotation 
    speed is 20.000 rpm and has a 1,5 MW power. The intake gas temperature is 620 
    degrees Celsius.<br>
    The engine injector and the liquid oxygen intake pipes are made of 304 L type 
    steel and the kerosene intake pipe is made of composite materials.<br>
    The second stage is spin stabilized at 60 rpm, immediately after staging. The 
    spin will be created using four helium RCS.<br>
