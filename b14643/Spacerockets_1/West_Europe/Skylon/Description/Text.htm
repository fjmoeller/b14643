<p><font color="#000080" size="2">SKYLON is a design for a single-stage-to-orbit 
spaceplane by the British company Reaction Engines Limited (REL), using <b>SABRE</b>, 
a combined-cycle, air-breathing rocket propulsion system.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000080" size="2">The vehicle design is for a hydrogen-fuelled aircraft 
that would take off from a conventional runway, and accelerate to Mach 5.4 at 26 
kilometres altitude using the atmosphere&#39;s oxygen before switching the engines to 
use the internal liquid oxygen (LOX) supply to take it into orbit. Once in orbit 
it would release its payload of up to 15 tonnes. The vehicle will be unpiloted, 
but also be certified to carry passengers. All payloads could be carried in a standardised 
container compartment. The relatively light vehicle would then re-enter the atmosphere 
and land on a runway, being protected from the conditions of re-entry by a ceramic 
composite skin. When on the ground it would undergo inspection and necessary maintenance.</font></p>
<p><u>Innovative SABRE engine</u><br>
The vehicle will operate in two modes: airbreathing mode and rocket mode. During 
airbreathing mode, it will attain a speed of 5.4 Mach 5 at an altitude of 26 km 
by collecting atmospheric air through two shock inlets. The atmospheric air entering 
the inlet will be heated up as it is compressed in the engine. It will be chilled 
to cryogenic temperatures before compression by a precool heat exchanger using liquid 
hydrogen and helium.<br>
Before switching to rocket mode, the compressed air will be converted to vapour 
but not liquefied, to reduce fuel consumption for cooling.<br>
The decrease of air density being inversely proportional to the altitude will allow 
the engine to switch to rocket mode. Pitch, yaw and roll control in rocket mode 
will be rendered by the combustion chambers. Liquid oxygen will be used to fuel 
the engines in the rocket mode and aid the spacecraft&#39;s ascent to the orbit.</p>
