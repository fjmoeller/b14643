    <font color="#000080">When Blue Streak was cancelled as a weapon, was announced 
    that the project would be continued as a satellite launcher. It is suspect that 
    this done to lessen the political trouble the cancellation brought, for although 
    there was quite some interest in a British space programme, there was no money. 
    The military were not interested in satellites, and the science budget could 
    not afford satellites and a launcher.<br>
    <br>
    The obvious design was to use <b>Black Knight </b>as a second stage for <b>Blue 
    Streak.</b> But it turned out not to be as simple as that: Black Knight was 
    too small to be an effective match for Blue Streak, and its 3 foot diameter 
    would lead to problems with satellites that were bigger. However, the brief 
    given to the design team was to come up with a satellite launcher that used 
    as many existing facilities as possible, and could be produced with the minimum 
    of extra development.<br>
    The limiting factor turned out to be the static testing beds at High Down. These 
    limited the diameter of the second stage to 4 foot 6 inches.<br>
    The design was soon finalised, but the question of cost again reared its ugly 
    head. Thorneycroft, who was then Minister of Aviation, tried involving the Old 
    Commonwealth - Canada and Australia - and although Australia was prepared to 
    provide Woomera, there was little other interest.<br>
    <br>
    Efforts with the Commonwealth having failed, Thorneycroft went to the French, 
    and two years further down the line from the original Blue Streak cancellation, 
    ELDO started to emerge. The price for this, though, was the second stage going 
    to the French. Europa One was little more than a redesigned Black Prince.</font></font></p>
