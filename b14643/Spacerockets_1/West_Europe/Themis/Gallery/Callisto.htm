      <td width="107%">ESA and ArianeGroup now signed a contract to develop a full-scale 
      Callisto demonstrator to be ground tested in November 2020.<br>
      Callisto its progress is somewhat separate from <u><i>Prometheus Methane/LOX 
      engine</i></u>. Callisto will need to launch with a different engine because 
      it will be too small for the new Prometheus engine, and also because Prometheus 
      will not be ready to fly on Callisto in 2020.<br>
      As the project matures, larger versions would fly that could then potentially 
      use Prometheus.<br>
      The Callisto vehicle is a single stage vehicle equipped with a 40 kN class 
      LH2/LOX engine, with thrust modulation capability of 40%. The main mission 
      objective is to be able to perform a so-called “Tossback” flight profile, 
      which includes in particular:<br>
      - A classical ascent phase<br>
      - A “ballistic” attitude change phase, so-called “tilt-over”<br>
      - A “boostback” flight phase which aims at targeting the landing site<br>
      - A guided reentry phase<br>
      - A final boost which enables to reach touchdown conditions compatible with 
      the vehicle design<br>
      <font size="2"><br>
      </font>Preliminary design studies showed that vehicle diameter has a major 
      impact on performance, and shall result from extensive trade-off between accommodation 
      (propulsion subsystem in particular) and mass.<br>
      The reference vehicle has a diameter of around 1 m, with a total height around 
      13.5 m. It is equipped with two main external features compared to a classical 
      operational launcher:<br>
      Deployable fins, which are folded during ascent and are unfolded during the 
      ballistic phase before reentry : they enable to stabilize and control the 
      vehicle during its atmospheric entry.<br>
      Four landing legs, which are also folded during ascent and deployed very shortly 
      before landing. A preliminary design has been done with the objective of ensuring 
      both sufficient engine clearance with respect to ground and stability at touchdown</td>
