and preserve its independent access to space. The study will look towards 2025 for 
institutional missions covering a performance range from three tonnes into geostationary 
orbit (including a four tonne segment into sun-synchronous orbit (SSO)) through 
to eight tonnes. The NGL will be phased in with the <b>Ariane 5ME</b> (Midlife Evolution), 
an evolved version of Ariane 5 for which a preparatory programme was set in motion 
during the 2008 ESA ministerial conference. The Ariane 5ME represents a much-needed 
response to the institutional and commercial markets’ requirements for a medium-term 
launch capacity for heavy satellites in geostationary orbit (with a launch mass 
of more than 11 tonnes). <br>

<font size="2" color="#000080">Key technologies for the European Space Agency&#39;s 
next-generation launcher (NGL) began testing as details emerged of the timetable 
for ESA&#39;s decision for a new rocket by 2025.<br>
France&#39;s Vulcain X cryogenic propellant engine demonstrator&#39;s turbomachinery is 
being tested. The High Thrust Engine (HTE) demonstrator is for an NGL first-stage 
engine.<br>
<br>
The known NGL candidates are all expendable. A joint industry paper given by French, 
German and Italian FLPP participants at the 2008 International Astronautical Congress 
in Glasgow, recommended a two-stage, all-liquid oxygen and hydrogen-fuelled rocket 
that uses two to six strap-on solid rocket boosters (SRBs) to increase its GTO payload 
capability from 3,000kg to 8,000kg.<b><br>
</b><br>
The pressures on Arianespace come as France and Germany, Europe’s two biggest launch 
powers, are involved in high-level discussions on a midlife upgrade to the Ariane 
5 (the Ariane 5 ME) and the Next-Generation Launcher (NGL), that will follow it. 
The French position, echoed by Arianespace, is that market changes, such as a gradual 
increase in midsize payloads that are typically paired with larger satellites in 
Ariane 5 missions, are eroding the Ariane 5’s dual-mission business case.<br>
The Germans say the Ariane 5 will continue to be needed for institutional missions 
and that the NGL should be a complement, not a replacement, for the existing vehicle. 
They also want agreement on developing the Ariane 5 ME, now in the detailed definition 
phase, before starting work on the NGL.<br>
<br>
ESA&#39;s own Post-ECA programme expects payloads to get heavier in future. This programme 
is developing the Ariane 5 Mid-Life Evolution, which uses the FLPP/Post-ECA upper-stage 
VINCI engine, to deliver 11,500kg to GTO. The upgrade would include the VINCI engine, 
a brand new power plant that would replace the Ariane 4 heritage HM-7B engine used 
on the Ariane 5&#39;s ECA upper stage.</font></p>

</font></font><font size="2"><font color="#000080">Ariane 6 preparation will build 
on the work completed in the Future Launchers Preparatory Programme (FLPP), the 
activities within the Ariane 5 post-ECA programme (such as the VINCI engine), and 
the results of national and industrial initiatives.<br>
Concepts handled within FLPP were gradually down-selected to a limited number of 
reference launch systems after top-level mission requirements in terms of performance 
and cost were considered, and the required technologies and readiness levels were 
identified.<br>
The overarching aim of Ariane 6 is to provide guaranteed access to space to Europe 
without requiring public sector support for exploitation.<br>
Ariane 6 is a single-payload launch system that can cover a wide range of missions: 
GEO, either directly or through intermediate orbits, in particular GTO and LEO, 
Polar/SSO, MEO or MTO, other.<br>
The targeted payload performance of Ariane 6 is 4 t for polar/SSO missions at 800 
km altitude and 3-6.5 t, with two main segments (3-3.5 t and 6-6.5 t) in GTO equivalent.<br>
The exploitation cost of the Ariane 6 launch system is its key driver. A first flight 
is targeted for 2021.<br>
<u>The Ariane 6 is a three-stages configuration (called PPH) </u>powered by solid 
propulsion for the lower composite (first two stages) and with a cryogenic liquid 
oxygen and hydrogen for the upper stage.<br>
For the lower composite, several options are being considered in terms of number, 
loading and arrangement of motors. For the upper stage, Ariane 6, similarly to Ariane 
5 ME Adapted, will use cryogenic propulsion for the upper stage based on the VINCI 
engine. It will be restartable and have direct deorbiting features.<br>
The preparatory work has begun, with a first phase of trade-offs between different 
PPH concepts that will lead to the selection of one Ariane 6 concept by the second 
quarter of 2013. Analysis will begin on the selected concept during the feasibility 
stage, planned for completion in mid-2013. The complete development of the Ariane 
6 launch system will be proposed at the 2014.</font><br>

<font color="#000080" size="2"><b>2013</b> -- <b>The European Space Agency has approved 
the configuration of its Ariane 6 space rocket.</b><br>
The rocket is required to lift up to 6.5 tonnes of payload into geostationary orbit, 
covering government and commercial needs.<br>
This concept was selected after six months of trade-off studies done by a “plateau 
projet” integrating industrial teams (Astrium, Avio, Herakles and the participation 
of Safran, MT Aerospace and others) working under ESA contract, consistent with 
Ministerial decisions mentioned above.<br>
The agency will now consult with the wider space industry and gather competing ideas 
for how to build the new system and the fine details on the design.<br>
Ariane 6 is sketched as a lower-cost flexible launcher able to place a single payload 
of between three and 6.5 tonnes in geostationary orbit.<br>
Its first stage would comprise three monolithic P-135 motors (diameter 3.7 m), set 
in a line as opposed to a more conventional &quot;cluster&quot; configuration, that would 
be powered by 135 tonnes of solid propellant.<br>
The second stage will also be driven by a P-135 solid-propellant motor.<br>
The third will be propelled by a planned liquid-fuelled engine, Vinci, designed 
to be restartable rather than a single-burn motor, to give more options for placing 
payloads in complex orbits.<br>
The in-line trio of motors will burn for a few minutes before separating and falling 
away. A second solid stage will then ignite and lift what remains of the vehicle 
into space.<br>
This too will separate once exhausted, to allow the liquid-fuelled Vinci upper-stage 
to complete the task of placing the satellite in its final intended orbit.<br>
The second stage will have a booster that is very similar to the ones on the first 
stage - not exactly, because the second stage will have to ignite out of the atmosphere 
and so will have to be adapted a little bit.<br>
The clam-shell fairing will have a diameter of 5.4 m - the same as Ariane 5.</font></p>

<font size="2" color="#800080">In a compromise, now the ESA Executive and European 
launcher industry have defined a modular Ariane 6 in two configurations to serve 
the medium and heavy launch segments as from 2020, and a Vega upgraded launch system 
(Vega C) to serve the small launch segment. Ariane 6 will profit from the best re-use 
of Ariane 5 Midterm Evolution results and investments and from the common use of 
a solid rocket motor (P-120) as both first stage of Vega C and strap-on booster 
for Ariane 6.</font></b></p>
