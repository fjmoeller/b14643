Vision Into Aerospace) * European Launch Vehicle (ELV S.p.A.)<br>
<font color="#000080"><br>
The European Space Agency will definitely proceed with the development of the
</font><font color="#FF0000">VEGA</font><font color="#000080"> (Vettore Europeo 
di Generazione Avanzata) launcher using Ariane booster technology. VEGA is a three-stage 
launch vehicle using solid motors. The first launch is planned for 2007. It is planned 
that Arianespace would operate and commercialise the&nbsp; launch service from Kourou. 
Prime contractors will be FiatAvio and EADS. VEGA will consist of three solid propellant 
stages and a liquid propellant upper stage. The first stage P80 Advanced Solid Booster 
will also be used to increase the performance of the Ariane 5 in its twin-solid 
rocket booster system, with new features such as a new gimballing nozzle. The second 
stage will be Italy&#39;s Zefiro motor. The third stage be a modified Zefiro booster 
and the upper stage an Attitude and Vernier Upper Module with storable propellants. 
VEGA will be able to place about 1.5 tons into an SSO. The final decision on the 
development of the small launcher VEGA is expected to be taken in October 1999 by 
the ESA Council.<br>
</font></font><font color="#000080" size="2">After about two years of defination 
and consolidation activities, the current VEGA configuration, including the new 
P80 FW first stage, two additional solid-propellant stages Zefiro (<span class="tx">the 
Zefiro motor development was initiated by FiatAvio under company funding and contracted 
by the Italian Space Agency</span>) as, respectively, second and third stages, and 
the AVUM upper modul, had been established and was ready for development as an ESA 
program. The specified mission for VEGA is: launch of a payload of up to 1500 kg 
into a circular 700 km-altitude polar orbit. VEGA will be able to launch satellites 
for a wide range of missions and applications, into orbits with a range of inclinations 
from 5.2 degrees to SSO, with altitudes between 300 and 1500 km, and with payload 
masses ranging between 300 and 2500 kg from Kourou. VEGA is designed as a single-body 
vehicle composed of three solid-propulsion stages, an additional liquid-propulsion 
upper module, and a fairing for payload protection. The three solid stages perform 
the injection of the upper composite into a low-altitude orbit. The upper module, 
called AVUM ( Attitude and Vernier Upper Module), is used to improve the accuracy 
of the primary injection, to circularize the orbit, and to perform the empty-stage 
to deorbiting manoeuvre.<br>

    <font color="#000080" size="2"><b>First stage:</b> The first stage is based 
    on the adoption of the new P80 FW solid-rocket motor being developed through 
    a parallel Program slice. P80 FW Technology Choises: CFRP monolithic carbon 
    fibre case, HTPB 1912 propellant. The P 80 FW maximum vacuum thrust is 3015 
    kN. The nozzle has a throat diameter of 496 mm and an expansion ratio about 
    1: 16. The nominal firing time is about 110 seconds. In addition to the P80 
    motor, the first stage is composed of the structural elements needed to connect 
    it to the second stage (interstage 1/2 aft part) and to the ground infrastructure 
    (interstage 0/1), and to host the stage avionics. Those airframes are aluminium 
    shells. The rear skirt (interstage 0/1) is a cylindrical structure, while the 
    interstage 1/2 is a conical structure.<br>
    <br>
    <b>Second stage:</b> The propulsion for the VEGA second stage is based on a 
    stretched version of the Zefiro 16 solid-rocket motor, with the propellant mass 
    increased to 24 tons. The new stretched SRM, known as Zefiro 23, employs: A 
    lightweight carbon-epoxy case, HTPB 1912 composite propellant, a moving nozzle, 
    based on flexible-joint technology. The Zefiro 23 maximum vacuum thrust is 1120 
    kN. The nominal firing time for the second stage is about 77 seconds. The nozzle 
    has a throat diameter of 294 mm and an expansion ratio about 1: 25. In addition 
    to the Zefiro motor, the second stage includes the structural elements needed 
    to connect it to adjacent stages and to host the stage avionics. The interstage 
    2/3 is an aluminium cylindrical structure.</font></p>

Third stage: </b>The VEGA third-stage propulsion is based on a solid-rocket motor 
with a propellant mass of 9.5 tons, known as Zefiro SRM and derived from Zefiro 
16. Zefiro 9 employs a carbon-epoxy filament-wound case, HTPB 1912 composite propellant, 
and a moving nozzle based on flexible-joint technology. Its maximum vacuum thrust 
is 317 kN, respectively. The nozzle has a throat diameter of 164 mm and an expansion 
ratio of 1: 56. The nominal firing time is about 119 seconds. An interstage connects 
Zefiro 9 to the AVUM, and hosts the stage avionics and the main safeguard unit.<br>
<br>
<b>Upper stage:</b> The AVUM (Attitude and Vernier Upper Module) upper stage is 
composed of two different sections, one hosting the propulsion elements (APM= AVUM 
Propulsion Module), and one dedicated to the vehicle equipment bay (AAM= AVUM Avionics 
Module). The APM provides attitude control and axial thrust during the final phases 
of flight. The total propellant loading will be between 250 and 500 kg, depending 
on the launcher configuration definition and the mission to be performed.<br>
<b><br>
Upper composite:</b> The upper composite includes the payload adapter and the fairing. 
The upper-stage configuration imposes the use of a conical structure in order to 
provide the required payload standard interface of 937 mm diameter. The reuse of 
an existing Ariane adapter is foreseen. For the fairing, a two shell configuration 
has been selected, with a 2.6 m external-diameter cylindrical part and a total height 
of 7.9 m – including a 3.5 m cylindrical part. The structure is made of two composite 
shells, composed of aluminium honeycomb and carbon skins.</font></p>
