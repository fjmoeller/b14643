    <td width="83%"><font size="2" color="#000080">The <b>Future Launchers Preparatory 
    Program</b> (<b>FLPP</b>) of the European Space Agency (ESA) is preparing the 
    next generation of launchers to be developed in Europe. The FLPP is a system 
    driven programme that targets the long term applications, with as well possible 
    short-mid term spin-offs. Its scope is threefold: launch vehicles system studies, 
    in-flight experimentation and on-ground maturation of technologies.<br>
    Three expendable launcher options are identified by ESA as potential solutions 
    to ensure an independent access to space for Europe in the decades to come:</font><ul>
      <li><font size="2" color="#000080">Evolution of the existing European launchers. 
      The Ariane 5 major evolution, that may be operational in 2016, would consist 
      in an advanced cryogenic upper stage utilizing an engine building on the FLPP 
      expander cycle demonstrator program</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" color="#000080">A new expendable mid-term launch system 
      relying on elements or “Building Blocks” from Ariane and Vega to be operational 
      by 2015</font></li>
      <li><font size="2" color="#000080">A new long-term launch system called the 
      Next Generation Launcher (NGL) to be operational by 2020-25.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2" color="#000080">The <b>BB-PPH launcher</b> is composed of:<br>
    A first stage derived from the large solid propellant booster of Ariane 5, i.e. 
    the MPS. The casing using the Filament Wound (FW) technology while the motor 
    itself is overloaded with respect to MPS up to 250 tons of propellant.<br>
    <br>
    A second stage derived from the first stage of VEGA launcher: P80. The motor 
    has a FW casing and is slightly overloaded w.r.t. P80 to 110 tons. <br>
    <br>
    The Cryogenic Upper Stage the architecture is derived from present Upper Stage 
    of A5ECA, with a higher loading: 28 tons. The engine using expander cycle is 
    able to deliver 180 kN in vacuum conditions.<br>
    <br>
    With a height of 62 m and a GLOW of 430 tons,this launcher will be able to deliver 
    3 tons in GTO orbit in its linear configuration. The implementation of two (respectively 
    six) strap-on boosters of 35 tons of propellant each would allow increasing 
    the GTO performance up to 5 tons (resp. 8 tons).<br>
    To serve the institutional need (e.g. LEO, MEO, SSO missions) which will request 
    a multi-boost scenario for the Upper composite, two options were investigated:<br>
    Cryogenic Upper Stage would be designed in order to be re-ignitable.<br>
    Terminal boost will be carried out by a Kick-stage employing MMH/NTO propulsion 
    technology.</font></p>
