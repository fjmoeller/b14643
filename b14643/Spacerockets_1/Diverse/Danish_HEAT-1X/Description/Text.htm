  size="2" color="#000080"> is a Danish non-profit rocketgroup initiated by two 
  men, who also are the designers and developers of the spacecraft. This spacecraft 
  is meant to carry one of the two men into space.The funding of the project is 
  provided by sponsors and donations. <b>Kristian von Bengtson </b>and <b>Peter 
  Madsen</b> are the entrepreneurs behind the organization and development of the 
  rocket HEAT, and the micro-spacecraft MSC. They are assisted by numerous volunteers. 
  If the project is successful it will become the first Danish manned space mission.<br>
  <br>
  The actual rocket development has resulted in numerous successful tests of the 
  solid fuel epoxy and the liquid oxidizer nitrous oxide, which was used in their
  <b>hybrid rocket</b> HATV (Hybrid Atmospheric Test Vehicle). The HATV rocket is 
  smaller as the HEAT rocket. This HEAT rocket (Hybrid Exo Atmospheric Transporter) 
  with liquid oxygen and polyurethane, will carry the MSC (The micro-spacecraft) 
  above the 100 km boundary and into space.The MSC supporting a person would be 
  800 mm in diameter, exclusive heat shield. The view dome is made of Perspex. The 
  HEAT booster will burn for about 60 seconds with 40kN of thrust, and produced 
  less than 3-g.<br>
  <br>
  Originally HEAT should have been fueled with paraffin wax but a ground test 28 
  February 2010 revealed that some of the paraffin wax only partially melted, instead 
  of evaporating. The result was that HEAT-1X had less power than expected. A ground 
  test firing of HEAT-1X-P (P for polyurethane) was conducted 16 May 2010.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
  The half-length (4m) version of the HEAT should flying with a crash test dummy 
  to 40 km altitude in June 2010. <br>
  <br>
  The first fullscale HEAT-1X testlaunch is planned to be off the coast of Bornholm, 
  on <b>31 August 2010</b>. The micro spacecraft (MSC) - named &quot;Tycho Brahe 1&quot; - 
  will carry a crash test dummy. Prior to re-entry it will jettison the booster 
  and decelerate by a succession of parachutes.The lower part of the rocket contains 
  the combined combustion chamber and solid fuel compartment (paraffin wax).&nbsp; 
  It follows the longer LOX tank. The graphite nozzle is not veerable. with a 640 
  mm diameter tube. The HEAT-1X test vehicle is a 640 mm diameter tube.</font></td>
