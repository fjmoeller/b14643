    commercial missions in the first half of 2019, according to the China Aerospace 
    Science and Technology Corporation (CASC). The launch vehicle, <b>Jielong</b> 
    (<b>Smart Dragon</b>) No.-1, will take on China&#39;s first commercial mission. 
    China plans to develop two types of rockets for commercial purposes, the <b>
    Jielong series and the Tenglong series</b>, according to Tang Yagang, president 
    of Chinarocket Co. Ltd. under the CASC.<br>
    The Jielong series are mainly solid propellant rockets which rely less on the 
    launch facilities and are flexible and the <u>Tenglong series are mainly 
    liquid propellant rockets with larger payload capacity.</u> There no 
    information to the Tenglong yet. It could be that there is an affinity to 
    the Naga-L (Dragon).<br>
    <br>
    The Smart Dragon-1 is a four stage solid-fueled launch vehicle equipped with 
    a reaction control system on the front cone of the launch vehicle. The launcher&nbsp; 
    has a total length of 19.5 meters, a diameter of 1.2 meters and a takeoff weight 
    of 23.1 tonnes.<br>
    Unusually for satellite launch vehicles, the payload volume is located between 
    the third and fourth stages, with the fourth stage motor and all payloads installed 
    in invert position during launch.<br>
    After separation of the third stage, the fourth stage is then flipped over for 
    the remainder of the mission.<br>
    <br>
    Smart Dragon-1 can launch a 200 kg payload to a 500 km altitude Sun-synchronous 
    Orbit (SSO), or 150 kg to a 700 km high SSO. Two types of payload envelopes 
    are provided: 1.1 meters diameter, 1.5 meters length or 1.4 meters diameter, 
    2.0 meters in length.</font></p>
