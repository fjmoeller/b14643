      Changzheng 1 (CZ-1)</font></b><font size="2"><br>

      <br>
      The CZ-1 was China’s first space launch vehicle. The rocket was based on the 
      two-stage DF-4 liquid-propellant IRBM, added with a solid-rocket third-stage. 
      The CZ-1 only made two launches, sending China’s first artificial satellite 
      Dongfanghong 1 into the orbit on 24 April 1970, followed by the second satellite 
      Shijian 1 on 3 March 1971.<br>
      The development of the CZ-1 was originally assigned to the Eighth Academy, 
      with Wang Xi-ji being the chief designer. The programme was later reassigned 
      to the First Academy (now China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, CALT), 
      with Ren Xin-min being the chief designer.<br>
      <b><br>
      Development</b><br>
      The CZ-1 development was initiated in July 1965 in response to the demand 
      for a rocket booster to launch China’s first satellite Dongfanghong 1 (Project 
      651). It was decided that the Shanghai Academy of Mechatronics (SAM) would 
      be tasked with the development of the civilian rocket Changzheng 1, so that 
      the First Academy could continue the development of the ballistic missiles. 
      The CZ-1 design team was led by Wang Xi-ji, the deputy chief of the SAM.<br>
      With no previous experience in developing large rocket, the design team decided 
      to base the space launch vehicle on the DF-4 liquid ICBM, which was under 
      development at the First Academy. In order to achieve enough velocity to escape 
      the Earth gravity, a solid rocket-powered third-stage would be added to the 
      two-stage DF-4. This design would enable the rocket to send 300kg payload 
      into 400km LEO inclined at 70°.<br>
      The Fourth Academy developed the GF-02 solid rocket motor with the ability 
      to ignite at high altitude. The solid rocket motor was tested onboard the 
      T-7A sounding rocket. Two launches were conducted in August 1968, both of 
      which were successful. The test results showed that the rocket motor could 
      be ignited at any altitude from less than 100km to 320km.<br>
      In November 1967, the National Defence Science &amp; Technology Commission (NDSTC) 
      decided to combine the DF-4 and CZ-1 programmes. The CZ-1 development was 
      reassigned to the First Academy headed by Ren Xin-min. The First Academy was 
      asked to speed up the development of the DF-4/CZ-1, with the aim to launch 
      China’s first satellite in 1968.<br>
      The First Academy made some amendments to the original CZ-1 design. The modified 
      design had a launch weight of 81.5 tonnes and a launch thrust of 104 tonnes. 
      The rocket was 29.46m in length and 2.25m in diameter. The first- and second-stage 
      of the launch vehicle were completely identical to those of the DF-4. The 
      third-stage was fitted with its own flight control for the gliding stage of 
      the flight. The fuel mass was increased from 900kg to 1,800kg. The original 
      inertial guidance on the third-stage was replaced by a simpler spin-stabilisation. 
      Explosive charges were adopted for the separation of the second- and third-stage 
      and the jettison of the payload fairing to improve reliability. The third-stage 
      was also added with a primitive telemetry system.<br>
      The DF-4/CZ-1 development was interrupted by the political turmoil during 
      the Culture Revolution in the late 1960s. The missile was not ready for flight 
      test until 1969. The batch-01 produced in 1969 included 7 two-stage flight 
      test examples and 2 three-stage space launch vehicles.<br>
      Following two unsuccessful attempts in late 1969, the first depressed trajectory 
      flight test of the DF-4 was conducted from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre 
      on 30 January 1970. The two stages of the missile separated and the second-stage 
      ignited successfully as scheduled, and the warhead hit the target spot with 
      high accuracy. The success of the test flight paved the way for the maiden 
      flight of the CZ-1 to send China&#39;s first satellite into space.<br>
      <br>
      In 1969, the First Academy proposed an improved model CZ-1A, which featured 
      a newly-designed liquid-propellant, three-axis stabilised, fully-guided third-stage 
      to give greater payload capacity and orbit insertion accuracy. The launch 
      vehicle would be used to launch the Dengta 1 navigation satellite and the 
      Shijian 2 scientific satellite. However, the project did not go ahead.<br>
      Two further improved variants, designated CZ-1B and CZ-1C, were proposed in 
      the late 1970s, but neither had entered the engineering development stage.<br>
      In the 1990s, CALT introduced the CZ-1D as a small-life launch system for 
      the commercial space launch market. The launch vehicle featured redesigned 
      second- and third-stage for improved reliability and greater payload capacity 
      (800~1,000kg to 200km LEO, or 350kg to 900km SSO). It made a successful maiden 
      flight in November 1997, but hasn&#39;t flown since then.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Propulsion</b><br>
      The first- and second-stage of the CZ-1 were designed by the First Academy 
      based on the DF-4 IRBM, and were built by 211 Plant situated in south suburb 
      of Beijing. Both stages used a liquid bipropellant, with unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine 
      (UDMH) as fuel and nitric acid (HNO3) as an oxidiser.<br>
      The first-stage of the rocket was powered by an YF-2 liquid rocket engine, 
      which consisted of four parallel YF-1 chamber motors.<br>
      The second-stage was powered by a single YF-3 liquid rocket engine, which 
      was a high-altitude version of the YF-1 (?) capable of working in a vacuum 
      environment. Development began in 1965 and completed in 1968.<br>
      The third-stage was powered by a GF-02 solid rocket motor developed by the 
      Fourth Academy in Inner Mongolia. Development began in April 1967 and the 
      motor was successfully tested in late 1969.<br>
      <b>Airframe</b><br>
      The airframe of the CZ-1 consisted of payload fairing, telemetry instrument 
      compartment, flight control instrument compartment, four propellant tanks, 
      two inter-stage sections, heat-resistant fuel tank bottoms and fuel/gas pipelines.<br>
      The CZ-1 adopted a “hot” inter-stage separation, where the adjacent stages 
      were separated by the impingement of the hot exhaust gas jet from the engine 
      of the ongoing stage. The engine of the second-stage ignited when the two 
      stages were still connected together, thus, eliminating the need for jettisoning 
      devices to provide the separation impulse and considerably reducing the none 
      control duration during the separation. A fibreglass heat insulation layer 
      is added on the top of the first-stage tank to prevent damage due to the high 
      pressure and hot stream of engine exhaust from the upper stage.<br>
      The addition of the third-stage increased the length-diameter ratio of the 
      CZ-1 to 13.27, which had weakened the rocket’s structural strength. To reduce 
      the rocket’s length as much as possible, the fuel and the oxidiser tanks were 
      combined into a single tank divided by a floor structure. The second-stage 
      motor was also direct mounted to the lower part of the propellant tank, so 
      that the tank formed part of the stage’s thrust and weight bearing load structure. 
      The two modifications had shortened the rocket’s overall length by 2m.<br>
      <b>Guidance</b><br>
      The CZ-1 used a cascade compensation inertial guidance system, similar to 
      that of the DF-4. As the rocket needed to fly powerlessly for 280 seconds 
      before the ignition of the third-stage engine, a flight control system was 
      added using pressurised nitrogen gas to maintain the course of its flight.<br>
      The third-stage of the launch vehicle was unguided, using spin-stabilisation 
      to maintain its flight course. It relied on a timing device to generate signals 
      for initialising the spin and satellite separation. <br>
      <br>

      <br>
      The CZ-1D was introduced by CALT in the late 1990s as a small-lift launch 
      vehicle for the commercial space launch market. The launch vehicle was based 
      on a specially modified DF-4. The vehicle made its first successful flight 
      on 1 November 1997, but has never flown for a satellite launch mission.<br>
      The CZ-1D was capable of sending 1,000 kg payload to a 200km LEO inclined 
      at 28.5°, or 350 kg payload to a 900km SSO. The increased payload and accuracy 
      was achieved by employing a N2O4/UDMH second-stage, and a 3-axis stabilised 
      solid third-stage.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Propulsion</b><br>
      The first-stage was powered by an YF-2A&nbsp; liquid rocket engine, which 
      was an improved version of the original YF-2 on the CZ-1. The sea-level thrust 
      was increased by 81.2 kN, and the sea-level Isp was increased to 2,378 N.s/kg.<br>
      On the original design, the second-stage of the CZ-1D was to be powered by 
      two parallel YF-40 engines burning the N2O4/UDMH propellant.<br>
      The propulsion of the third-stage consisted of a FG-36 solid rocket engine 
      and a DaFY2-1 auxiliary engine. The solid engine used the HTPB solid propellant, 
      with 645 kg propellant carried onboard. The auxiliary engine, which used the 
      N2O4/UDMH propellant, was designed to maintain the course of flight during 
      the gliding stage. The engine consisted of four 1.2 kN/1.6 kN chamber motors 
      and twelve 25 N chamber motors, located on the third-stage symmetrically.
      <br>
      <b>Airframe</b><br>
      The CZ-1D shared the same (?) airframe design in its first- and second-stage 
      with the original CZ-1. The diameter of the third-stage was increased from 
      1.5m to 2.05m. The original cone-shaped inter-stage section between the second- 
      and third-stage was replaced by a cylinder-shaped design, which also accommodated 
      the main and auxiliary thrusters of the third-stage. <b><br>
      Guidance</b><br>
      The CZ-1D had adopted a platform-computer inertial guidance system, which 
      allowed the third-stage of the rocket to be 3-axis stabilised.</font></td>
