The <b>CZ-7</b> is the medium-lift variant in China’s new-generation orbital launch 
vehicle family. The core vehicle of the CZ-7 is a two-stage rocket 3.35m in diameter. 
The first-stage uses a K3-1 module powered by two YF-100 engines burning the LOX/Kerosene 
propellant. The second-stage uses a K3-2 module powered by four YF-115 engines that 
also burn the LOX/Kerosene propellant. The vehicle can be attached with two or four 
2.25m-diameter K2-1 modules as strap-on boosters, each powered by a single YF-100 
engine.<br>
The YF-100 has staged combustion, Chinese industry officials say, referring to a 
challenging but efficient technology. The engine has achieved a 305-sec specific 
impulse, a key measure of efficiency, they add. The 18-ton-thrust second-stage engine 
of Long March 7, which may be named YF-115, has been revealed as using staged combustion.
<br>
The CZ-7 is expected to succeed the CZ-2F for the launch of Shenzhou spacecraft 
and the unmanned cargo resupply ship to the space station. It is also likely going 
to replace all existing medium-lift launch vehicles such as CZ-2C, CZ-2D, CZ-3A/B/C, 
and CZ-4B/C for LEO, GTO and SSO launch missions.<br>
The launch vehicle will be available in both man-rated and cargo versions. The man-rated 
version will be capable of delivering 12,500 kg payload to LEO. The cargo version 
will be capable of delivering 13,500 kg payload to a 400x200km LEO inclined at 42°, 
or 5,500 kg payload to a 700km SSO.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0"><b>2016, June 21 -- CZ-7 maiden launch</b></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0"><font size="2">The <b>DFFC</b> (Duoyongtu Feichuan Fanhui 
Cang) is subscale model of a future Chinese manned space capsule.<br>
Reportedly outfitted with basic systems like a navigation system, heat shield, parachutes 
and a communications system capable of transmitting through the plasma occurring 
during the hypersonic re-entry sequence.<br>
It was launched on the maiden flight of the CZ-7/YZ-1A rocket. It remained attached 
to the YZ-1A upperstage with the ZGZ Shiyan Zhuangzhi. The upper stage provided 
also the reentry manouevre for the DFFC capsule.<br>
<u>The DFFC capsule successfully returned to earth on 26 June 2016.</u><br>
<br>
The ZGZ Shiyan Zhuangzhi (Zai Guijia Zhu Shiyan Zhuangzhi) or In-Orbit Refeuling 
Experimental Device is a fluid-transfer experiment launched by China&#39;s new generation 
CZ-7/YZ-1A launch vehicle in 2016.<br>
The experiment is mounted on the YZ-1A upper stage and remains attached. After the 
experiments, it is to deorbited with the upper stage.</font></p>
