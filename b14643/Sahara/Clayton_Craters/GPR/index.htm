      CRATERS USING GROUND PENETRATING RADAR<br>

      </b>&quot;We report results from a field survey performed on a recently discovered
      <i>impact</i> field in the southwestern Egyptian desert, using a 270 MHz Ground-Penetrating 
      Radar (GPR). Profiles across small-buried craters revealed a coherent sequence 
      of tilted layers constituting the cratonic infill resulting from aeolian deposits. 
      In the intercrater areas the radargram revealed a poorly defined subsurface 
      stratigraphy and the presence of shallow structural elements associated with 
      potential evidences of the consequences of the shock effects, i.e., faulting, 
      fractures, and chaotic bedrock. The radarpenetration depth varied from 2 to 
      15 m, depending mainly on the amplitude of the volume and multiple scattering 
      in the subsurface, caused by fractures and debris.</p>

          <td width="60%"><b>GPR Survey Setup and Results:</b> We profiled four 
          small buried craters where we crossed the investigated structures in orthogonal 
          directions in 30-meters-long profiles. Our profiles confirmed the morphology 
          of small buried craters partially outcropping at the surface. On the 30-m-long 
          radar transect crossing the <font color="#FF0000">GKCF-28</font> crater, 
          we can clearly distinguish the crater curvature, with its nearly flat 
          bottom (due to the presence of breccias) being located 4 m deep, about 
          one-tenth its diameter.<br>
          This typical ratio has been observed on all four of the small craters 
          covered by the GPR study. The figures shows layered deposits (in yellow) 
          in the crater filling.<br>
          <u>A predominant feature on the radargram near the bottom of the crater 
          is the fractured and brecciated bedrock that diffuses and scatters the 
          radar signal, giving rise to the purple hyperbolic-like forms observed 
          at 6 m depth.</u> All four GPR profiles obtained for the buried craters 
          revealed the same subsurface morphology: a perturbed hemispherical structure 
          buried under sediments. Radar was unable to resolve any structure under 
          the craters, due to the strong volume and multiple scattering in the bedrock.&quot;</td>

      <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">My diagnosis:</span> Since it has since 
      been proven that all structures (cater-like or dykes) are of volcanic-tectonic 
      origin, we can interpret the results of the GPR contrary, even in such an 
      insignificant crater. The predominant feature on the radargram under the bottom 
      of the crater is not fractured and brecciated bedrock. It is very likely a 
      plug of a volcanically shaped breccia that was non-explosively uplifted. The 
      edges of the crater are made of squetched bedrock, which also may contain 
      parts of breccia.<br>
