          <font face="Times New Roman" size="2">&quot;Four of the authors collected unusual 
          samples from a meter-sized boulder found among tabular formations of sandstone 
          in the north of the Gilf Kebir plateau, <u>about 160 km SSE of the Libyan 
          desert glass (LDG) area.</u><br>
          The rock is dark gray in color, very compact (i.e., no vesicles), and 
          strongly magnetic. Whole rock analyses are as follow (in wt%): SiO<sub>2</sub> 
          40.5; Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 30.8, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 22.7, 
          TiO<sub>2</sub> 4.4, with remarkably low alkali (Na<sub>2</sub>O+K<sub>2</sub>O 
          = 0.1 wt%) and CaO (0.1 wt%) contents. <u>In thin section, the rock displays 
          a magmatic aphanitic-microlitic texture with microlites of mullite </u>
          (Al<sub>4.2</sub>Fe<sup>3+</sup><sub>0.2</sub>Si<sub>1.6</sub>O<sub>9.8</sub>),
          <u>an Fe-rich spinel close to magnetite, and an Fe-Ti oxide, in a mesostasis 
          of nearly pure Silica. Tridymite has been identified in the mesostasis, 
          as well as in segregation veinlets. Rounded, relict quartz grains also 
          occur and are surrounded by tridymite.</u> Platinum group element (PGE) 
          concentrations in the melt rock are within the range of the average continental 
          crust with iridium as an exception, slightly more elevated. These PGE 
          patterns are similar to those measured for LDG.<br>
          This melt rock has a composition and mineralogy that is, to our knowledge, 
          unreported from any terrestrial magmatic rock. Phase diagrams in the system 
          SiO<sub>2</sub>-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>-FeO-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> 
          suggest that temperature about 1600 °C is needed to melt a rock with such 
          a composition. Considering the location of recovery, and the lack of vesicles, 
          an anthropogenic origin is highly unlikely. The PGE signature of the melt 
          rock is neither diagnostic of an impact origin, nor the contrary, as is 
          also the case for the PGEs in LDG. Although the chemical composition of 
          the rock and the high-temperature involved in its formation eem to be 
          pointing to an impact origin, no high pressure phases ave so far been 
          detected.&quot;</font></p>

          and is considered as a indicator for the thermodynamic transformations

              &quot;A group of smoothly wind-sculpted medium-dark grey rocks were found 
              partly buried in the sand approximately 160 km SSE of the LDG strewnfield 
              (GPS coordinates 23°48.0&#697;N, 26°11.5&#697;E). Two blocks estimated to weigh 
              80 and 50 kg were found, as well as four blocks in the 10 kg range, 
              plus some smaller fragments. A 14-kg block was found at a distance 
              of about 10 m, but searches yielded no additional similar material 
              nearby. No outcrop was identified. The largest rock was found at the 
              centre of a 15-m ring of white rocks. The discovery was made on 1 
              February 2007 by Didier Bernon and Martine Linares (e-mail of René 
              Lorillard, 1 April 2017).<br>
              The rock is very compact, and although also finegrained and highly 
              magnetic, with wind-sculpted concavities that are much larger and 
              smoother, and an absence of voids. Exposed surfaces were slightly 
              greenish.<br>
              In addition to magnetite, Fe3O4, the main constituents are SiO2 and 
              mullite (3Al2O<sub>3</sub>•2SiO<sub>2</sub> or 2Al2O<sub>3</sub>•SiO<sub>2</sub>), 
              an uncommon refractory mineral with a melting point of 1840°C whose 
              synthetic equivalent is used in the manufacture of crucibles and furnace 
              linings. The matrix of the rock is of silica and includes silica glass 
              and relict quartz grains, as well as tridymite, a high-temperature 
              polymorph of SiO2. Nickel-bearing magnetite (trevorite, NiFe<sub>2</sub><sup>3+</sup>O<sub>4</sub>) 
              was also detected but not awaruite (Ni<sub>2</sub>Fe to Ni<sub>3</sub>Fe). 
              Other phases, identified by Wolfgang Bach (e-mail, 15 October 2013), 
              were phosphates of calcium, aluminium and rare earths, ilmenite, and 
              hercynite. Bach described his samples as having a ‘quench texture’. 
              Rocks with similar compositions have not been reported from elsewhere 
              (see Ferrière et al. (2009). Platinum group element (PGE) concentrations 
              in the magnetite-mullite rock ‘are within the range of the average 
              continental crust with iridium as an exception, slightly more elevated. 
              These PGE patterns are similar to those measured for LDG’ (Ferrière 
              et al. 2009)&quot;.</font></p>

      The petrographical and mineralogical studies carried out on the breccia&nbsp;

      of the quartz grains some of these grains show PFs and PDFs. The zircon of

      nature of some the studied grains and by non-stoichiometric contents of ZrO2

      SPHERULES FROM THE GREAT SAND SEA (WESTERN DESERT, EGYPT)<br>
      A. M. Fioretti et al. -- </b>61st Annual Meteoritical Society Meeting, 5073.pdf<br>
      <br>
      &quot;During a joint Italian-Egyptian expedition in the Western Desert (Egypt) 
      dark &quot;brush-strokes&quot; fading were observed along the flanks of some sand dunes.<br>
      Optical investigations showed that the dark dust is mainly composed of subrounded 
      to well-rounded opaque grains of high sphericity, mixed with minor amounts 
      of quartz and silica glass grains. Among them, small, absolutely perfect spheres, 
      with a smooth, polished surface and a metallic lustre are clearly manifest.<br>
      Small amounts of magnetic particles studied by reflected light and SEM; chemical 
      compositions were obtained by WDS-EMPA. The rounded opaque minerals are mostly 
      magnetite, ilmenite and hematite.<br>
      The oxidised spherules are 100 to 200 microns long, with metal Fe-Ni eccentric 
      cores 40 to 100 microns long. The external shells show typical dendritic structures.<br>
      Spherules with very different core compositions are found (e.g. Fe80Ni20 - 
      Fe5Ni95) within each of the six samples, whereas the oxides constituting the 
      shells show more uniform, Ni-depleted, compositions.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080"><u>Comment</u>: The spherules are certainly not micrometeorites, 
      but aeolian or fluvial reprocessed material from subvolcanic hotspots with 
      iron and magnetite deposits in the Great Sand Sea.</font></p>

      16 vol% relictic silicate objects, 9.5 vol% opaques (mainly mm to submm-sized 
      metal/sulfide grains), and 8.5 vol% numerous homogeneously distributed voids 
      (on average &lt; 0.3 mm in size).<br>
      Microscopically, the major part of the silicate fraction is matrix material 
      that clearly shows the texture of a quenched <font color="#FF0000">melt consisting 
      of about 57 vol% Fe-Mg silicates and 9 vol% glass.</font> Relictic olivine 
      and low-Ca pyroxene (16 vol%) are present as isolated grains in the quenched 
      melt matrix and as unmelted remnants in “ghost” chondrules. The latter have 
      circular shapes and are composed of relictic olivine or/and pyroxene with 
      interstitial melts.<br>
      The melt rock fraction consists of short-prismatic olivine with grain sizes 
      &lt;30 ìm, &lt;50 im-sized augite and interstitial glass. Large olivine grains in 
      melt rocks are zoned with Fe increasing towards the surface. No shock effects 
      are present in either olivines nor pyroxenes. Glasses in melt rock portions 
      are inclusion-free but locally contain crystallites of Fe-Mg silicates. Relictic 
      olivines and pyroxenes are both &lt;0.3 mm in size and contain tiny troilite 
      and metal blebs. In addition, features like planar fractures, mosaicism and 
      mechanical twining indicate shock alteration of the relictic silicates.<br>
      Metal and troilite mainly occur as nodules (average size &lt; 0.5 mm) of irregular 
      to rounded shapes. Some troilite nodules include large droplets of metal consisting 
      of Ni (kamacite and taenite). Micrometer - sized metal and troilite globules 
      and particles are dispersed throughout the melt. Regions enriched in such 
      globules resemble shock veins or melt pockets.<br>
      Relictic chromite occurs as fractured single grains with subhedral to anhedral 
      shape, whereas newly formed chromite forms clusters of small euhedral to subhedral 
      crystals.</font><font size="1">&quot;</font></p>
