            is part of an alkaline basaltic intracontinental flood basalt field 
            in central Libya. The northern part the Al-Haruj is marked as Jabal 
            Al-Aswad. The smaller southern part is marked as Jabal Al-Abiyad.<br>
            Trigger of the volcanic activity in the Al-Haruj and the neighboring 
            areas could have been a so-called mantle-plume, which probably already 
            in the Mesozoic from the outer Earth&#39;s core to the frontier between 
            mantle and crust penetrated and remained for a long time under the African 
            plate. When a plume hits the bottom of the lithosphere, it is partially 
            melted and thinned. This causes the Earth&#39;s crust to stretch, causing 
            certain sections of the Earth&#39;s surface to sink and rifts were formed 
            (tectonic trenches). The Al-Haruj is located in the so-called Hun-Graben.<br>
            The eruptions of the magma took place in the Al-Haruj on this fault 
            zone. The eruption activity periodically flooded the sediments in area. 
            Pyroclastites (ashes, lapilli and tuffs, etc.) are almost completely 
            absent in Al-Haruj. Petrographically, the volcanic rocks in Al-Haruj 
            are mainly alkaline basalts with olivine and pyroxene as well as feldspars. 
            Such (mostly potassium-rich) rocks are typical of continental rift zones.<br>
            Morphologically, flood basalt fields and lava flows predominate in the 
            Al-Haruj. Shield volcanoes, cinder cones as well as diatrems and pit-crater 
            sit on the flood basalts. The oldest lavas in the Al-Haruj are about 
            5.3 million years old, the youngest probably only thousands of years.<br>

            of Geosciences, <b>2015</b>, 6, 109-144<br>

            </font><b><font face="Arial" size="1">&quot;The Al Haruj Intra-continental 
            Volcanic Province is the largest part of the extensive volcanic activity 
            in Libya which is considered to be a typical within plate basalts. The 
            volcano-tectonics evolution of this province, as well as its origin, 
            are still widely disputed. According to K-Ar dating previously studied, 
            the volcanic activity started in the Late Miocene and lasted until at 
            least the Late Pleistocene. The field may still be volcanically active. 
            The mafic rocks of Jabal Al Haruj have been classified into six major 
            phases or groups. These phases have been differentiated using Landsat 
            images together with aerial photographs of different scales as well 
            as field observations. The topographic forms of the earliest phase are 
            highly eroded while the forms of the latest phase are usually fresh 
            and very well preserved as regards primary features. Mafic lavas of 
            this field consist of alkali basalts to olivine tholeiites (transitional 
            basalt) which contain olivine as essential constituent together with 
            clinopyroxene, plagioclase and glass. The basalt exhibits intergranular, 
            intersertal, ophitic and subophitic relations. Amygdaloidal and glomerporphyritic 
            textures are also observed. The basaltic rocks of different ages and 
            from different localities are petrographically rather similar.<font color="#FF0000"> 
            Phenocrysts of olivine probably the result from slow cooling in crustal 
            magma chambers prior to eruptions, suggesting that magmas ascended slowly 
            through the crust</font>. 109 samples have been carefully collected 
            from various phases, some of these samples have been chosen for major 
            and trace elements analyses, using XRF in order to determine the characteristics 
            of the mantle source and investigate crustal interaction. The major 
            and trace elements revealed a slightly significant chemical diversity 
            among the phases and within each phase. The normative classification 
            of most of these rocks shows close agreement with their modal classification. 
            A vague correlation between MgO and most major oxides in the studied 
            samples suggests different degrees of partial melting rather than fractional 
            crystallization. A characteristic feature of the studied volcanic rocks 
            is the relatively constant ratios of certain incompatible trace elements 
            (Nb/Zr, Rb/Zr), which provides strong evidence of a common source. In 
            addition, the rocks display similar patterns of the peaks and troughs; 
            this strongly suggests that they have a common parent and common subsequent 
            processes. The compatible transitional metals Ni (81 - 193 ppm) and 
            Cr contents (238 - 361 ppm) and relatively low Mg# (Mg/(Mg + Fet)) (52 
            - 62) give an indication that the studied basaltic rocks have slightly 
            to moderately fractionated olivine and/or spinel. The magmatism of this 
            volcanic field seems to be related to reactivation of pre-existing structures 
            during the passive rifting of the Sirt Basin that most likely produced 
            in response to convergence between European and African plates since 
            Jurassic until Holocene times.&quot;<br>

      <p><b><font size="4" color="#000080">2. Volcano Wau-en-Namus</font></b></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">&quot;The Wau-en-Namus lies southeast of Al-Haruj. The 
      cone itself consists of a massive sequence of poorly sorted lapilli agglomerate 
      that appears well stratified from a distance. The agglomerate, locally enclosing 
      bombs and some ash, shows no mesoscopic welding effects and is somewhat friable. 
      It is thus deduced that ejecta must have considerably cooled prior to cone 
      build up. However, at a small area of the cone there is congealed twisted 
      spatter in the form of ribbon bombs attesting perhaps to the waning eruptive 
      activity of the volcano as the magma reservoir emptied and pressure dropped.<br>
      The slopes of the cone are marked by huge rills in places and in others by 
      curling up and outward bulging thin crust of ash and sand in the vicinity 
      of gashes and cracks, both suggesting escaping volcanic gases. The underside 
      of the crust in such localities shows nodular to botroidal deposits of white 
      salts and yellow sulfur. The latter may also occur as small thin tablets scattered 
      around or in the form of yellow staining on adjacent rock blocks. All of these 
      features appear recent and suggest continued, slow activity of a dormant volcano.<br>
      Repeated eruption at the site is attested to by locally slumped agglomerate 
      strata, truncation of the present cone of two earlier structures to the west, 
      and a collapsed dome on the northern side where a shallow, bowl-like crater 
      had developed.&quot;</font></p>
      <p><font color="#000080">&quot;The Wau-en-Namus is a remote and isolated volcanic 
      caldera complex composed of alkalibasaltic scoria, located in southern Libya 
      at 24°56&#8242;N, 17°45&#8242;E, about 70 km south of the Pliocene-to-Holocene Al-Haruj 
      volcanic field. The Wau-en-Namus caldera has a diameter of about 4 km and 
      is surrounded by an extensive halo of black ash and lapilli. </font>
      <font color="#FF0000">No lava flows are present at the crater, but bombs and

      rises about 140 m above the floor of the caldera. A reliable 40Ar/39Ar age 
      determination of the host basalts was impossible due to the extremely low 
      radiogenic content of the matrix. Step-heating of the whole-rock material, 
      however, suggests that the K-rich matrix is very young.&quot;</font></p>

      peridotite xenoliths</font> in Quaternary nepheline-basanite and melilite- 
      or sodalite-bearing lavas of the Wau-en-Namus volcano&nbsp; range from lherzolites 
      to harzburgites recording melt extraction in a shallow setting (&#8804;2 GPa). Primary 
      clinopyroxenes have distinct trace element characteristics documenting LILE 
      (large ion lithophile element) depletion or enrichment events predating the 
      formation of glass pockets and veins in the xenoliths. These glasses are aluminous 
      and alkali-rich, range in composition fromultrabasic to silicic (43–67 wt.% 
      SiO2) and may contain empty vugs and micro-phenocrysts of olivine, clinopyroxene, 
      spinel, plagioclase, sodalite, apatite that are similar in composition to 
      phenocrysts in the host lavas. Reactions of infiltrating melt and xenolith 
      minerals are documented by diffuse Fe–Ca-rich rims of olivine in contact with 
      glass, and by spongy-textured reaction domains caused by incongruent dissolution 
      of primary pyroxenes and spinel. Some glasses have trace element characteristics 
      similar to that of the host Ne-basanite, suggesting they were derived from 
      the same source during entrainment and transport to the surface. Incompatible 
      element enrichment and Sr–Nd isotopic compositions of the analyzed host lava 
      are similar to HIMU (high &#956;; &#956;=238Pb/204Pb)-type magmas, but the Pb isotopic 
      composition is less radiogenic compared to other intra-plate Neogene magmatic 
      rocks from N Africa.&quot;</font></b></p>

      After searching of the craters-field was to be ascertained, that could be 
      a context to the Tertiary flood basalts in Haruj. The new craters-field is 
      found near in the southwest of the large basalt shield of the Al-Haruj. There 
      is a large ring structure and many small craters. Some are covered evidently 
      with outflows of basalt. One crater has a similarity to the Oasis crater (nearby 
      Kufra). The large ring-structure is crossed by long dykes. </font></p>
