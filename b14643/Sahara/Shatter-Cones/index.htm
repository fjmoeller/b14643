      derived by the observation of shock-related structures, such as Shatter-Cones 
      and planar deformatiuons in quartz grains. These craters (several hundred) 
      are however of subvolcanic origin and the shatter-cone like structures are 
      not valid. Related forms were found also outside of the crater field in the

          Shatter cones are commonly described as being conical striated fracture 
          surfaces formed due to hypervelocity <i>impact</i>. Other structures having 
          similar, but not identical morphological elements include blast fractures 
          and natural percussion marks, slickensides, wind abrasion structures and 
          cone-in-cone structures. Precise identification of shatter cones is necessary 
          to prevent confusion with these similar structures. A criteria for the 
          identification of shatter cones is based on elements of their morphology 
          combined with field habit. Three basic criteria must met for structure 
          to be considered a valid shatter cone:</font></p>
          <ul>
            <li><font face="Verdana" color="#000080" size="1">The structure must 
            be a conical, or part conical, fracture surface</font></li>
            <li><font face="Verdana" color="#000080" size="1">ridge and groove striations 
            diverging from an apex or central striae must be present</font></li>
            <li><font face="Verdana" color="#000080" size="1">and the structure 
            must be pervasive and not surficial.</font></li>
          </ul>
          <p><font face="Verdana" color="#000080" size="1">Blast fractures are true 
          fracture surfaces, but do not display a conical fracture surface. Most 
          commonly they consist of a radiating array of planar fractures. Percussion 
          marks result from the <i>impact</i> of boulders in a rapid flow, fluvial 
          setting. They comprise a conical fracture surface that may include crude 
          striations, so their morphology is super-ficially similar to that of a 
          shatter cone. However, their occurrence is restricted to the outcrop surface 
          and, as such, they do not form a pervasive fracture System throughout 
          the rock. Slickensides have ridge and groove striations similar to those 
          of a shatter cone. However, the fracture surface is planar, or occasionally 
          curviplanar, and lacks the conical shape and divergent striations of shatter 
          cones. Cone-in-cone structures are not fracture surfaces, but are displacive 
          growths of calcite within a carbonate-rich sediment. As such they possess 
          a characteristic internal structure that is distinct from that found in 
          shatter cones. Conical structures formed as a result of wind abrasion 
          lack fracture surface and are spatially restricted to outcrop surfaces 
          and prevailing wind direction at the time of formation. if care is taken, 
          the above evidence can be used to distinguish true hatter cones formed 
          by hypervelocity <i>impact</i> from other conelike structures at the mesoscopic 
          scale (i.e., in the field). At the microscopic scale, shatter cones may 
          be further distinguished by the localization of planar deformation features 
          PDFs) in the vicinity of the cone surfaces, as well as by the presence 
          of spherules (vapor condensates) and high pressure polymorphs indicative 
          of shock.</font></p>

      <font color="#000080"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">A CRITICAL GUIDE FOR 
      IMPACT-CRATER HUNTERS</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="1"><br>
      A publication of the Impact Field Studies Group (IFSG), vol.2. Winter 2005<br>
      Bevan M. French, Smithonian Institution<br>
      <br>
      Shatter cones are the only known megascopic (outcrop and hand-specimen scale) 
      feature accepted as evidence of <i>impact</i>. Ideally, they occur as distinctive 
      multiple sets of curved and striated fractures that form cones or partial 
      cones and penetrate large volumes of target rocks in <i>impact</i> structures. 
      Shatter cones, even when poorly developed, tend to be directional: the cones 
      generally (but not always) point upward and inward (toward the shock-wave 
      source at the <i>impact</i> point), and the striations radiate backward from 
      the apex of the cone, diverging and multiplying along the cone surface to 
      form a unique texture (&quot;horsetailing&quot;).<br>
      Well-developed shatter cones are distinctive, impressive, and unique indicators 
      of <i>impact</i>. Less well-developed shatter cones may form nearly-planar 
      striated surfaces which may lack directionality and which may be ambiguous.<br>
      Caution! Shatter cones, both good and bad, can resemble other geological features: 
      sedimentary cone-in-cone structures, fault slickensides, and wind-abrasion 
      features. However, shatter cones have distinctive features that help identification. 
      If you are standing on what you think is a shatter-coned outcrop, check the 
      following points. Shatter cones form in all rock types - igneous, sedimentary, 
      and metamorphic. The best shatter cones form in fine-grained rocks (limestones 
      and shales). Shatter cones in coarser-grained crystalline rocks are cruder 
      and harder to recognize. The orientation of shatter cones depends on their 
      location relative to the centre of the <i>impact</i> structure, and they will 
      therefore be oriented at any angle to sedimentary bedding. Shatter cones are 
      penetrative fractures; freshly-broken samples will show shatter-coned interior 
      surfaces. Shatter-cones have positive and negative surfaces; a convex cone 
      may nest snugly within a reversely-striated concave surface. Both positive 
      and negative shatter-cone surfaces will show grooves with positive and negative 
      relief. If you have surfaces that aren&#39;t curved, show only a few striations, 
      and have no radiating pattern, then play it safe; don&#39;t use such features 
      as an <i>impact</i> indicator.<br>
      Shatter cones have been recognized and argued as <i>impact</i> criteria for 
      more than half a century, but their mechanism of formation, and the conditions 
      under which they form, are still not well-established. They apparently form 
      at relatively low shock pressures (=&gt;2GPa), but may also develop at pressures 
      =&gt;30 GPa. Shatter cones formed at higher pressures (=&gt;10 GPa) in quartz-bearing 
      rocks may also contain distinctive microscopic shock features such as PDFs 
      in quartz.</font></font></p>
