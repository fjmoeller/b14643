      The oldest intrusive rocks on the Uweinat-Howar Uplift are of Precambrian 
      age. By their general geologic setting, macroscopic appearance and bulk composition, 
      at least two principal suites can be recognized (RICHTER 1986):</font></p>

      of red alkaline granites and grey-green granitoids of Precambrian age can

      Ma (<b>Ordovician</b>). They have intruded migmatites and orthogneiss.</font></p>

      <p align="justify"><font face="Times New Roman" size="2" color="#000080">are 
      of Tertiary age. The most prominent one is <b>Jabal</b> <b>Uwainat</b>, the 
      intrusive part of the massive is almost completely situated in Libya. Another 
      ring complex is <b>Jabal Babein</b> to the north of Jabal Uweinat, nearby 
      the border between Libya and Egypt. Ring complexes lying completely inside 
      Libya are <b>Jabal Arkenu </b>and<b> Jabal</b> <b>Bahari</b>. In the southeast, 
      in Sudan, the ring complex of <b>Jebel Kissu</b> is rising as a prominent 
      landmark above the gravel plains.<br>
      The dessected oval structure of the <b>Jabal Babein</b>, with its longer axis 
      trending north-northwest, is emplaced in Precambrian gneiss and red granite. 
      The highly complex intrusion is essentially composed of outer quartz syenite 
      ring-dyke and a central white, medium to fine-grained, granite. The syenite 
      shows little variation, and is a pink, coarse-grained, equigranular rock containing 
      major perthitic alk-feldspar, subordinate plagioklase with minor biotite and 
      quartz. Basic to acidic cone sheets are intercalated and, in many places, 
      variably composed dykes have penetrated the complex.<br>
      <b>Jabal Bahari</b> appears to consist of a single ring dyke of medium to 
      coarse-grained pink granite, while <b>Jabal Arkenu</b> is mainly made up of 
      medium to coarse-grained nepheline syenite beside subordinate syenite with 
      trachyte and pyroclastic phonolithe in the centre.<b> Jebel Kissu</b> is built 
      up by a steep outer ring of coarse-grained syenite, deeply weathered to large 
      boulders, and a centre of sheeted, fine-grained quartz syenite. The complex 
      is cut by frequent dykes of intermediate to basic composition and variable 
      thickness.</font></p>

      </font><font face="Times New Roman" size="2" color="#000080">In the <b>Jabal 
      Uweinat</b> (Libya) we can see the unusual circular structure. These structure 
      are the surface expression of a granitic intrusion. This granite intruded 
      into the Archaen/Proterozoic metamorphic Basement as well as Paleozoic sandstone 
      strata along a ring fracture. Three igneous activities has occured probably 
      in the Early Oligocene age (42-46 Ma).<br>
      The composite intrusion of the Jabal Uweinat is roughly circular with a diameter 
      of about 23 km, and is flanked on the northern side by three smaller overlapping 
      intrusive rings which are aligned along a north-northeast-trending axis. The 
      main complex is composed of deeply weathered alkaline rocks, forming very 
      large well-rounded blocks. The outer rim is formed by coarse-grained quartz 
      syenite which steeply slopes toward the surrounding basement. The rock is 
      assembled of quartz up to 12% and major euhedral perthitic alk-feldspar beside 
      minor aegirine. Toward the centre, in the south and west, the outer intrusive 
      ring is followed by a highly complex zone of coarse-grained quartz syenite 
      and coarse to fine-grained alkali granite. This zone forms the outer rim in 
      the north. According to KLERKX &amp; RANDLE (1976), similar to the syenite the 
      alkali granite is essentially composed of subhedral alk-feldspar but with 
      an increased amount of interstitial quartz and aegirine. The central depression 
      of the ring complex is occupied by a reddish, fine-grained quartz syenite 
      with trachytic matrix that encloses rare phenocrysts of K-feldspar. The rock 
      is locally cut by trachytic dykes and sills. A steep inner slope around the 
      central quartz syenite depression is build up by alternating cone-sheets of 
      syenite, consisting largely of perthite with no quartz.</font></p>
