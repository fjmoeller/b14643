            <td width="57%" bgcolor="#FFFFCC">&quot;We have studied a small, very unusual 
            stone, here named “Hypatia”, found in the area of southwest Egypt where 
            an extreme surface heating event produced the Libyan Desert Glass 28.5 
            million years ago. It is angular, black, shiny, extremely hard and intensely 
            fractured. We report on exploratory work including X-ray diffraction, 
            Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron 
            microscopy with EDS analysis, deuteron nuclear reaction analysis, C-isotope 
            and noble gas analyses. Carbon is the dominant element in Hypatia, with 
            heterogeneous O/C and N/C ratios ranging from 0.3 to 0.5 and from 0.007 
            to 0.02, respectively. The major cations of silicates add up to less 
            than 5%. The stone consists chiefly of apparently amorphous, but very 
            hard carbonaceous matter, in which patches of sub-&#956;m diamonds occur. 
            &#948;13C values (ca. 0‰) exclude an origin from shocked terrestrial coal 
            or any variety of terrestrial diamond. They are also higher than the 
            values for carbonaceous chondrites but fall within the wide range for 
            interplanetary dust particles and comet 81P/Wild2 dust. In step heating, 
            40Ar/36Ar ratios vary from 40 to the air value (298), interpreted as 
            a variable mixture of extraterrestrial and atmospheric Ar. Isotope data 
            of Ne, Kr and Xe reveal the exotic noble gas components G and P3 that 
            are normally hosted in presolar SiC and nanodiamonds, while the most 
            common trapped noble gas component of chondritic meteorites, Q, appears 
            to be absent. An origin remote from the asteroid belt can account for 
            these features.&quot;<br>
            &quot;We propose that the Hypatia stone is a remnant of a cometary nucleus 
            fragment that impacted after incorporating gases from the atmosphere. 
            Its co-occurrence with Libyan Desert Glass suggests that this fragment 
            could have been part of a bolide that broke up and exploded in the airburst 
            that formed the Glass. Its extraordinary preservation would be due to 
            its shock-transformation into a weathering-resistant assemblage.&quot;</td>

          The emergence of the desert glass, with an estimated total mass of about 
          1400 tons, is definitely <u>NOT</u> caused by an airburst or an impact, 
          but is an exceptional &quot;volcanic&quot; glass. For the melting of sand masses 
          at the surface by an airburst, there were no conditions in the Oligocene 
          period. The land surface was a rocky ablation area. A sandy desert did 
          not exist.<br>
          In contrast to the obsidian is the desert glass not a conventional volcanic 
          glass because it contains 96-99% SiO2. It must be presumed that it before 
          28.5 million years as a pure glass melt along a deep fault in the earth&#39;s 
          crust flowed. Corresponding flowing structures are visible in the glass. 
          In the glass were identified fourteen nano-sized crystalline, also polymorphs 
          of diamond and graphite.<b><br>

              The earliest mineralogical studies, which was carried out by Aly Barakat 
              indicated that the material consists of; <b><font color="#FF0000">
              diamond, graphite</font></b>, goethite, quartz calcite, halite and 
              serpentine. Diamond aggregations occur as tiny angular grains (fragments) 
              showing the characteristic lustre and cleavage. Some of these grains 
              show indications of octahedral form, but others are suggestive of 
              partial hexagonal form. EDAX analysis of some grains indicates that 
              they consist essentially of C (~98 %). The XRD analysis data are consistent 
              with the presence of diamond of interplanar distances (d) 2.07, 1.259, 
              and 1.881 (JCPDS, card 6-675) as indicated by the Camera method. Moreover, 
              diamond appears through the chart of the other X-ray diffraction method. 
              Raman spectrometric analysis of the bright aggregates confirms the<b><font color="#FF0000"> 
              presence of diamond in a polycrystalline status</font></b>, as witnessed 
              by the significantly broad peak at 1331 cm-1 (spectra b and d). In 
              spectrum (b), diamond is associated with graphite (peak in the 1580 
              cm-1 region). In spectrum (d), the broad band at 1332 cm-1 is a good 
              evidence for the presence of diamond in the form of microcrystalline 
              aggregates (note the sharp peak of the well crystalline diamond on 
              the reference spectrum c). Thus, the observed large grains represent 
              quite large aggregates of micrometer-sized crystallites. <b>
              <font color="#FF0000">Graphite</font></b> occurs as thin laminated 
              encrustation coating and embedding the diamond aggregations. The Raman 
              spectroscopy confirms also the intimate association between graphite 
              and diamond. Graphite is also present in the form of microcrystalline 
              grains. The single peak at 1580 cm-1 is of crystalline graphite (mean 
              basal plane &gt;&gt;1000 Å). This phase is also known as the G mode. Progressive 
              disorder in graphite is reflected in the Raman spectrum by the broadening 
              and shifting of this band to higher wave numbers, and by development 
              of an additional band near 1360 cm-1 (also known as the D mode). The 
              peak around 1360 cm-1 in spectrum b is a convolution of two peaks. 
              This is due to the presence of both diamond and graphite in intimate 
              association. Goethite occurs also as a filling of fissures and cracks. 
              In spite of its low crystallinity, goethite is detected by X-ray diffraction 
              analysis by its diagnostic d-spacings at 4.17, 2.68, 2.57, 2.44, 2.17 
              and 1.713, which coincide with the JCPDS (Card 29-713). <br>
              A crystalline silica phase has been reported as tiny grains within 
              the fractures of specimen during microscopic investigations. X-Ray 
              diffraction analysis showed the presence of quartz. Indeed, more precise 
              analysis is still required to identify whether the silica phase is 
              coesite and/or stishovite. However, detritus silica seems likely as 
              quartz grains introduced to the specimen through fractures. Calcite 
              occurs as thin filling of fracture and parting planes. The presence 
              of calcite has been confirmed by the scanning electron microscopic 
              investigation. Treatment of the sample with dilute HCl indicated the 
              presence of carbonate. Halite occurs as tiny white grains inserted 
              inside fractures. Halite seems to be of late diagenetic origin, as 
              it also occurs as thin coating of both diamonds and graphite aggregations.</font></td>

          An expedition in November 2011 to the find area of &quot;Hypatia&quot; failed to 
          recover additional hand specimens of &quot;Hypatia&quot; material, but samples of 
          pedogenic (Cenozoic) pebbly deposits. One of these samples was collected 
          3.5 km south of the Hypatia sampling site (25°18.11&#39; / 25°29&#39;).<br>
          After fractional separations of the sample was identified evidence of
          <b><font color="#FF0000">hard amorphous carbon and submicron diamonds</font></b> 
          as well as unusual metallic mineral grains, all those found in the &quot;Hypatia&quot; 
          stone.<br>
          The unusual metallic grains and carbonaceous particles tentatively grouped 
          into 4 types<br>
          <u>Type I</u> grains and spherules range from 10-20 &#956;m up to 130 &#956;m. SEM-EDX 
          data indicate that the smaller spherules are metallic with a wide compositional 
          range comprising Ti, Ag, Al, and Si in varying porportions, and Ca, O, 
          Na, Mg and S as variable, minor constituents. The largest spherules are 
          pale green and vitreous and consist entirely of P, Si with no detectable 
          oxygen. <br>
          <u>Type II</u> grains are much larger (length: 60 &#956;m to 1.2 mm) and consist 
          of<br>
          a) sintered aggregates of Pb metal particles<br>
          b) strongly sintered clusters of &#945;-Ti (+1.0 at.% Al) subgrains<br>
          c) more brittle aggregates of seemingly submicron, Sn-Ca alloy particles.<br>
          The Ti metal grains in places host clusters of quenched gas bubbles, blobs 
          of Ti alu-minide, veinlets of non-stoichiometric Ti nitride, Al oxycarbonitride, 
          and particles of Zr, Ag, and Zn. A distinctive feature of the Type II 
          grains is their localized coating by (C, O bearing) carbonaceous films 
          and filaments up to 300 &#956;m in length. Although these resemble fungal hyphae 
          and tendrils in SEM images, Raman spectra prove that they comprise partly 
          graphitized kerogen. <br>
          <u>Type III</u> grains are shard-like in shape and occur either as partly 
          oxidized branching (70 &#956;m x 50 &#956;m) Al particles decorated by &#956;m-size Bi 
          granules, or as lace-textured Ti particles partly enveloped by Type II 
          grains. Petrographic textural analysis of multiple 3-D sections of the 
          shard indicate that the Type II (and perhaps Type I) grains were derived 
          from the partial to complete melting of the Type III shards. <br>
          <u>Type IV</u> grains are morphologically and compositionally diverse, 
          with common characteristics being Carbon as the major constituent. Moissanite 
          (SiC) grains were the first to be positively identified from petrography 
          and Raman spectra. Other grains display a range of textures, including 
          one resembling a honeycomb with N as second major constituent and minor, 
          varying amounts of S and Cl. The Raman spectra of these N-rich grains 
          show faint, indistinct D and G bands but distinctive peaks in the 3000 
          cm-1 region, indicative of C:H bonds. </font></span></p>

          <font size="2">Matter originating from space, particularly if it represents 
          rare meteorite samples, is ideally suited to be studied by Particle Induced 
          X-ray Emission (PIXE) as this analytical technique covers a broad range 
          of trace elements and is per se non-destructive. We describe and interpret 
          a set of micro-PIXE elemental maps obtained on two minute (weighing about 
          25 and 150 mg), highly polished fragments taken from &quot;Hypatia&quot;, a controversial, 
          diamond-bearing carbonaceous pebble from the SW Egyptian desert. PIXE 
          data show that &quot;Hypatia&quot; is chemically heterogeneous, with significant 
          amounts of primordial S, Cl, P and at least 10 elements with Z &gt; 21 (Ti, 
          V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Os, Ir) locally attaining concentrations above 500 
          ppm. Si, Al, Ca, K, O also occur, but are predominantly confined to cracks 
          and likely represent contamination from the desert environment. Unusual 
          in the stone is poor correlation between elements within the chalcophile 
          (S vs. Cu, Zn) and siderophile (i.e.: Fe vs. Ni, Ir, Os) groups, whereas 
          other siderophiles (Mn, Mo and the Platinum group elements (PGEs)) mimic 
          the distribution of lithophile elements such as Cr and V. Worthy of mention 
          is also the presence of a globular domain (Ø S 120 lm) that is C and metals-depleted, 
          yet Cl (P)-enriched (&gt;3 wt.% and 0.15 wt.% respectively). While the host 
          of the Cl remains undetermined, this chemical unit is enclosed within 
          a broader domain that is similarly C-poor, yet Cr–Ir rich (up to 1.2 and 
          0.3 wt.% respectively). Our data suggest that the pebble consists of shock-compacted, 
          primitive carbonaceous material enriched in cold, pre-solar dust.</font><p>

              <td width="64%"><font size="2">In 1996 a very unusual ~30 g sized 
              pebble was found in the Libyan Desert Glass strewn field where abundant 
              fragments of impact-related silica-rich glass are found. This brittle 
              black stone consists of ~70 wt. % carbon, and has a hardness comparable 
              to diamond, reminiscent of carbonados. These authors performed an 
              exploratory analytical study on &quot;Hypatia&quot;, including XRD, SEM, Raman 
              spectroscopy, TEM, and analyses of C and noble gas isotopes motivated 
              by the fact that this stone was found in the area of the Libyan Desert 
              Glass (LDG). Noble gas isotope analysis is central to the study of 
              meteorites because these rocks formed from multiple components with 
              distinct noble gas isotopic signatures that help to constrain their 
              origin and evolution. Among these components, the so-called Q phase 
              dominates the budget of heavy noble gases (Ar, Kr Xe) in chondrites 
              originating from the asteroid belt.<br>
&nbsp;Kramers et al. (2013) concluded that Hypatia is extra-terrestrial, based on 
              40Ar/36Ar ratios as low as about 40. They noted that O/C ratios (0.19 
              - 0.51) in Hypatia are higher than in chondritic Insoluble Organic 
              Matter (IOM). In addition, they reported that the trapped Ne, Kr, 
              and Xe in &quot;Hypatia&quot; indicate the occurrence of the nucleosynthetic 
              P3 and G components of presolar origin known from meteorites (Ott, 
              2014), while the Q (and HL) components ubiquitous in chondrites were 
              absent in &quot;Hypatia&quot;. The combined evidence led them to conclude that 
              &quot;Hypatia&quot; did not originate in the asteroid belt where chondrites 
              likely formed. They suggested instead that it formed in a more external 
              region of the solar accretion disk, such as the Kuiper Belt, where 
              presolar components might be more abundant, i.e., that &quot;Hypatia&quot; could 
              be of cometary origin. They further proposed that the airburst of 
              the parent comet of &quot;Hypatia&quot; resulted in the formation of the Libyan 
              Desert Glass.<br>
              In this work we extend the study by Kramers et al. (2013) with isotopic 
              analyses of all five noble gases in several mg-sized fragments of 
              &quot;Hypatia&quot; in two different laboratories (CRPG Nancy, France and ETH 
              Zürich, Switzerland) and with a nitrogen isotope investigation performed 
              both at CRPG (Nancy) and IPG-Paris. We also describe results from 
              X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments and transmission electron microscopy 
              (TEM) observations performed at the University of Jena (Germany). 
              An attempt to determine the oxygen isotopic composition in &quot;Hypatia&quot; 
              by the Nancy Cameca 1280 ion probe failed because of the reduced size 
              of oxygen-bearing phases and because of the presence of contaminants 
              and important amounts of water.</font></td>
