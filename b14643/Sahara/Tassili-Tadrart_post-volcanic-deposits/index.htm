      &quot;Along the wadi banks on the inner parts of the Tadrart Acacus Massif, at 
      an elevation ranging from 900 to 1000 m a.s.l., calcareous tufa were identi&#64257;ed 
      (<i>Cremaschi et al., 2010; Zerboni &amp; Cremaschi, 2012).</i> Outcrops of this 
      kind of deposits were found within rock shelters, along vertical fractures 
      inside relict solutional tunnels, and on vertical cliffs; they are related 
      to the horizontal boundary between sandstone and thin, impermeable beds of 
      shale or &#64257;ne-grained sandstone beneath (<i>Cremaschi et al., 2010</i>). In 
      the central part of the Tadrart Acacus, tufa deposits occur as thin laminated 
      crusts on the &#64258;oors of rockshelters and belong to the pool and barrage types; 
      in the upper reaches of the wadis, up to several tens of meter long alignments 
      of massive &#64258;owstone line vertical walls (<b>Figure 8)</b>. An alignment of 
      calcareous tufa on a vertical cliff along the upper reach of wadi Imha. In 
      the latter case stalactites may be 2 m long. The microscopic properties of 
      tufa are discussed by <i>Carrara, Cremaschi, and Quinif (1998)</i> and <i>
      Cremaschi et al. (2010</i>), with several U/Th and radiocarbon dates placing 
      their deposition to the Early Holocene (<i>Cremaschi et al., 2010</i>). Due 
      to the topographic and geologic position of tufa and their sedimentological 
      characteristics, we de&#64257;ne them as spring tufa and their occurrence indicates 
      the position of ancient springs that were active during humid phases.&quot;</font></p>

          <td width="52%"><font size="2">&quot;The tufa deposits were discovered during 
          a geoarchaeological survey in the Tadrart Acacus mountain conducted from 
          1994 to 2005, when almost all the wadi of the massif were examined. Nineteen 
          tufa outcrops were identified, and six of them were now sampled for laboratory 
          analyses. <br/>
          The calcareous tufa deposits crop out at the base of rock shelters and 
          niches, originated by undersapping processes and related to the horizontal 
          boundary between sandstone and thin, impermeable beds of shale or fine-grained 
          sandstone beneath. Tufa also formed along vertical fractures inside relict 
          silicakarst tunnels. In both cases tufa deposits occur as thin (3–20 cm 
          thick) laminated crusts at the floors of the rock shelters and belong 
          to the pool and barrage types. They also line the walls and roofs of the 
          cavities and tunnels as massive flowstone. Pool-, barrage-, and flowstone-type 
          tufa is uniformly white to light brown and well lithified. The laminar 
          structure, observed macroscopically, also clearly appears at the microscopic 
          level: cryptalgal and bacterial structures are embedded in a dense, whitish 
          yellow, micrite groundmass, which appear as very thin, planar or wavy 
          &quot;stromatolithic&quot; laminae containing calcified algal filaments, fan-shaped 
          branching algae and bacterial clumps. Compact tufa is laterally discontinuous 
          and grades into highly porous moss tufa consisting of tubules and phytoclasts. 
          In a few cases tufa also impregnates clastic deposits, such as aeolian 
          sand and detrital fragments of sandstone occurring mostly at the base 
          of the sequences.<br/>
          </font><font size="1"><br/>
          </font><font size="2">Six samples were U/Th dated. A single date is available 
          for the sample 05/56, a massive, sand-rich flowstone, located above a 
          small spring pool. A sequence of five dates (four U/Th and one AMS 14C) 
          was obtained on the sample from site 02/99, which is the thickest (130 
          mm) deposit identified; samples were taken from the top and the base of 
          each hand specimen and in correspondence to the main lithological discontinuities. 
          Two dates each were performed at the base and at the top of the samples 
          from the sites 94/96 and 94/49,<i> </i>obtained from flowstones, and on 
          sample TH128 (pool and dam type). U concentrations of the Tadrart Acacus 
          tufa deposits are high (4–12 ppm) and U-series analyses gave consistent 
          results, with the exception of sample TH96-2 (very high 230Th/238U ratio).<br/>
          An AMS 14C age was performed on the lower part of sample 02/99 and gave 
          8360±50 14C yr BP (9500–9250 cal. yr BP (2&#963;) using the INTCAL04 calibration 
          curve of Reimer et al., 2004.<br/>
          This result is in good agreement with the U/Th data, and supports their 
          reliability. The available dates indicate that tufas were deposited between 
          c. 9605 and 7634 yr BP. Most of the sedimentation occurred between 9500 
          and 8100 yr BP; a single date hints towards a slightly younger age in 
          one location (7634 yr BP).&quot;</font></td>

            </font><font color="#800080">Consolidated bedrocks (also sandstone) 
            of Paleozoic age 
            cannot absorb groudwater. Porosity and permeability are very low. No aquifer in the true sense can form. Rainwater 
            can only seep away along cracks in the sandstone and accumulate in cavities 
            etc. The infiltration rate into the &quot;aquifer&quot; of the Acacus Mts. was 
            consequently low despite intensive rainfalls and could not lead to a 
            saturated true aquifer with a high uniform water table, as it was declared. 
            Most of the rainwater ran off along the valleys towards the foreland. 
            A true “groundwater level” would also have been significantly lower, 
            since it is determined by the level of the foreland. The formation of 
            permanent small lakes at barriers was possible, but pent-up water would 
            have been exposed to constant exchange with rainwater, so carbonates 
            could not form autochthonous.<br>
            <font size="1"><br>
            </font>It is crucial, however, that there is no convincing 
            geological evidence for the thesis of carbonate precipitation 
            through solution processes in imaginary or at least hardly available 
            carbonate layers. There are therefore no prerequisites for the 
            meteogenic formation of travertine in this mountain region. The only 
            realistic possibility is the formation of these deposits by feeding 
            them from volcanic springs containing carbonates, and which may be 
            older than the Holocene, probably the Pleistocene. Such young 
            hydro-volcanic activities have nothing to do directly with the 
            volcanoes in the region (eg Adrar volcano southern of the Tassili 
            Mts).<br/>
            <font size="1"><br>
            </font>The usability of the determined age of the deposits with the 
            U/Th-dating method is questionable because the reliability of the method 
            is restricted in an &quot;open system&quot;. The deposits could have later been 
            contaminated by leachate in the rainy phase of the Holocene. An indication 
            of this is the likely new formation of flowstones (stalactites) in shelters. 
            The suspected organic residues appear to be phantoms.<br>
            <font size="1"><br>
            </font>The data found can only relate to the period of erosion, renewed 
            deposition (eg stalactites) and/or contamination. Since there is no 
            U / Th older data to before 9,500 yr BP, we should assume that the age 
            of the original carbonates cannot be determined using the U/Th method. 
            (Pleistocene ?)<br>
            <br>
            Pure carbonates can be seen in photos of the shelters. The microphotographs 
            presented in the publication are from other locations, of which there 
            are no photos. In a table one speaks of flowstones, presumably samples 
            of secondary stalagmites and stalactites. These can also contain contaminats 
            and foreign material. We can suspect that they were used for the analyzes.<br>
            <font size="1"><br>
            </font>Deposits of a sand and gravel mix in drainage valleys were consolidated 
            by carbonate muds from eroded volcanic springs.<br>
            Such deposits can be found in the Qued Djerat (Tassili Mts., Algeria) 
            or the Qued Tin Uded in the Algerian Tardrart Mts. The age of these 
            deposits is likely to be the same or younger than that in the Acacus 
            Mts. (Holocene).</font></b></p>

                  similar series of outcrops in a <b>Qued Tin Uded</b> in the Algerian 
                  Tadrart Mountains. Location: 23°54&#39;14&quot;N / 10° 55&#39;20&quot;E. This seems 
                  to indicate that these strange deposits are not limited to the 
                  Tassili Plateau. It is very plausible that carbonate mud, mobilized 
                  from still to be found older volcanic springs, has solidified 
                  the sand and debris-leading terrace deposits in drainage valleys. 
                  These kind of deposits also can be compared with some deposits
