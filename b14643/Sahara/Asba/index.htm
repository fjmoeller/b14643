      <p style="margin:0 5; "><font size="2"><font color="#000080">In the Upper 
      Ordovician Mamuniyat Formation fine and medium sandstones, numerous levels 
      of conglomerate are present. Beds with Tigillites have been observed. Metamorphic 
      sandstones have been observed at <b>Jabal Qardah</b> (30 km west of Jabal 
      Arkenu). Another small outcrop of metamorphic quartzites, more or less bedded, 
      is located 12 km N of Jabal al Qardah, corresponding with a fault running 
      approximately SE-NW. The age of these metamorphic sandstones is uncertain.<br>
      To the west of these last two reliefs, some scattered outcrops of the basement 
      -- both metamorphic and granitic -- are overlain by well-layered sandstones 
      which are generally medium and fine grained and reddish on the surface. A 
      level was discovered with frequent Tigillites. Approximately 4 km further 
      west, amongst the sandstone, siltstone levels appear in which it is sometimes 
      possible to observe frequent and notably developed <i>Arthrophycus (Harlania) 
      sp</i>.<br>
      The same Situation is to be found, well exposed in a relief, 2 800 km long 
      in a N-S direction and located 20 km WNW of Jabal Qardah. At the base, in 
      the southern zone of the relief, sandstones are present both well-layered 
      or very thick-bedded and pale in colour, which show a marked glacial morphology. 
      On this eroded, &quot;moutonnee&quot; surface, there are deposits of darker, more cemented, 
      medium- and coarse-grained and often cross-bedded, sandstones. More silty 
      levels, soft at the base, sometimes contain abundant, long <i>Arthrophycus</i>. 
      These upper sandstones are more than 40 m thick. In the northern part of this 
      relief, volcanic rocks of a basaltic type have intruded along a NW-SE fracture. 
      Phenomena of contact metamorphism between sandstones and basalt are quite 
      limited. The age of the basaltic intrusions is Oligocene.<br>
      The whole region W and N of this relief, for a depth of 10-12 km is occupied 
      by hundreds of pinnacles and conical hills of coarse- to fine-grained sandstones; 
      these are generally pale or whitish at the ase, often cross-bedded, more or 
      less cemented and typically oneycomb-shaped from wind erosion. These sandstones 
      underlie the shales of the Tanezzuft Formation and outcrop in a NE-SW alignment 
      (</font><font color="#FF00FF">section 10</font><font color="#000080">). In 
      the Jabal Asba area the</font> <font color="#000080">Ordovician is present 
      in various outcrops. <br>
      The characteristic morphology of very high pinnacles and blades is the result 
      both of a NW-SE System of fractures and of marked wind and glacial-type erosion. 
      Layered sandstones (Mamuniyat Formation) follow, often with parallel laminations, 
      fine- and medium-grained, from buff to violet, with some harder levels rich 
      in ferruginous cement, but generally slightly cemented. In the central western 
      zone of Jabal Asba, the</font> <font color="#FF00FF">section 4</font><font color="#000080"> 
      shows 64 m of Ordovician sandstones. The lower 57 m are represented by thick 
      beds of sandstones, fine- to coarse-grained, generally with parallel lamination. 
      The top of these sandstones shows a morphology characterized by large pinnacles 
      and blades directed NW-SE, rounded peaks and U-shaped valleys. Unconformably, 
      and with a fine conglomerate at the base, approximately 7 m of buff-brown 
      to reddish sandstone follow, medium- to coarse-grained, with clear cross-bedding, 
      which fill all the eroded parts of the underlying formation and are overlain 
      by the shales of the Tanezzuft Formation. These sandstones must be considered 
      as belonging to the Upper Ordovician Mamuniyat Formation.</font><br>
      <font color="#000080">Similar sandstones of the Mamuniyat Formations were 
      found in the NE area of Jabal Asba</font> (<font color="#FF00FF">section 13</font><font color="#000080">). 
      Sometimes there are beds with abundant and large fossil (<i>bioturbations</i>) 
      traces. Sandstones of the Mamuniyat Formation were found in the KW2 and KW3 
      shallow wells below the Tanezzuft shales.</font><br>

      <p style="margin:0 5; "><font color="#000080" size="2">Two formations were 
      recognized, Tanezzuft and Akakus, which are typical in the Silurian of the 
      surrounding Palaeozoic basins. The Tanezzuft shales have been described as 
      being up to 130 m thick in outcrops at the basin margins, but the shales were 
      found to be replaced by siltstones and sandstones in two dry exploration wells 
      drilled in the northern part of the basin by AGIP between 1978 and 1981.<br>
      <b>Tanezzuft Formation (Lower Silurian)</b>.<br>
      In the<b> Jabal Asba</b>, the Tanezzuft Formation outcrops over large extensions. 
      In the SW area of this relief, the </font><font color="#FF00FF" size="2">section 
      2</font><font color="#000080" size="2"> has shown 40-50 m of greenish and 
      grey shales, sometimes, on the surface, whitish or purple, very thinly layered, 
      soft, often with coating and dendrites of manganese, and with some interbeddings 
      of greyish, hard micaceous siltstone.<br>
      Some graptolites of the species <u><i>Climacograptus medius</i></u> (TORNQUIST) 
      were found. The Chitinozoa assemblage from 27-33 m consists <i>Ancyrochitina.</i> 
      According to the graptolites the interval from 18-31 m belongs to Lower Llandovery. 
      In core 36-37 m most of the Chitinozoa are absent and the assemblage is dominated 
      by the species <i>Conochitina chydaea</i> JENKINS in association with <i>Rhabdochitina 
      cf. magna</i> EISENACK and <i>Lagenochitina sp</i>.; these species suggest 
      an Upper Ordovician age (Caradocian-Ashgillian). In the same cores, traces 
      of small <i>Pelecypoda</i> and carbonaceous matter were found. The depositional 
      environment of this formation is open marine and its thickness in the central 
      and northern areas of Jabal Asba is 24 and 18.5 m respectively. At the base, 
      in contact with the sandstones of the Ordovician Mamoniyat Formation, a thin 
      level was observed with abundant traces due, in all probability, to worms. 
      This characteristic level was commonly observed at the Tanezzuft-Mamoniyat 
      boundary.<br>
      <b>Akakus Formation (Lower-Middle Silurian)</b>.<br>
      In the area this formation is well characterized from the lithologic and palaeontologic 
      point of view, but it shows very limited thicknesses everywhere. Region of
      <b>Jabal Qardah </b></font><font color="#FF00FF" size="2">(section 10)</font><font color="#000080" size="2">: 
      25 m of dark grey and grey-green, flaggy siltstone, with thin interbeddings 
      of fine-grained, cemented sandstone and micaceous shales. Rare indeterminable 
      fossil traces were observed on some surfaces. It is thought that the highest 
      part of this formation is eroded, due to the absence of Arthrophycus and Cruziana 
      beds, generally widespread in the whole region, and of the Tadrart sandstones; 
      in this section the Akakus Formation is unconformably overlain by the Middle-Upper 
      Devonian Binem Formation. Southern part of <b>Jabal Asba </b></font>
      <font color="#FF00FF" size="2">(section 2)</font><font color="#000080" size="2">: 
      this formation is represented by only 2-5 m of siltstone and fine-grained 
      sandstone, greenish-grey to reddish, with some interbeddings of silty-micaceous 
      shales. In the highest part there is a siltstone bed, hard, yellow and very 
      heavy with characteristic <i>stromatolitic </i>structure. This is a very widespread 
      level in the highest part of the Akakus Formation in this region. There are 
      extremely abundant sedimentary structures (ripple marks, flute casts, etc.) 
      and also fossil traces (<i>Cruziana furcifera, Arthrophycus sp.</i>, etc.). 
      The boundary with the underlying Tanezzuft Formation is rather gradual, whilst 
      it is very sharp, marked even with a base conglomerate, with the overlying

      a very porous sandstone, slightly cemented and medium to very thick bedded; 
      some thinner levels are of dark, hard ironstone. Sedimentary structures are 
      represented by cross-beddings, foresets, laminations and slumping phenomena. 
      In some cases there are well developed phenomena of overturned cross-bedding

      and with cross-beddings, overturned cross-beddings, foresets, parallel and 
      cross-laminations, slumpings, etc. In this sequence there are also dark, hard

      In the <b>Jabal Qardah </b>(</font><font color="#FF00FF" size="2">section 
      10</font><font color="#000080" size="2">), the greatest thickness of Binem

      is unconformably overlain by multicoloured (whitish, pale grey, purple, etc.), 
      fine-grained sandstones, generally cemented, with some very thin beds of reddish 
      hard siltstone, with ferruginous cement and sometimes with abundant <i>Zoophycus</i>.<br>
      At the top, the section is formed of sandstones as above, sometimes only slightly 
      cemented, with some interbeddings of siltstone and silty shales and thin beds, 
      or crusts, of hard, red-purple siltstones. Beds with abundant <i>Zoophycus</i> 
      (their size varying from a few cm up to 20 cm) and a few other fossil traces 
      are common. A wide sandy plain separates the top of this formation from the

      Remains and moulds of plants (<i>Licopodophyta</i>) were observed in the lower 
      part. A further 21 m of fine sandstones and siltstones follow, more or less 
      clayey, thinly bedded and multicoloured with common bioturbations and rare 
      specimens of large <i>Bifungites sp</i>. (5-6 cm in size).<br>
      The upper part of the section is represented by sandstones, coarse- to fine-grained, 
      sometimes with irregular beds of fine conglomerate, generally only slightly 
      cemented, harder in the higher part, with some levels of clayey and flaggy 
      siltstone. Numerous beds have provided various moulds and remains of plants 
      (<i>Licopodophyta</i>) and of roots; bioturbations occur locally. This sequence 
      is unconformably overlain by the Continental Mesozoic.</font></p>

      <p style="margin-left: 5"><font color="#000080" size="2">&quot;The lower <b>Silurian 
      Tanezzuft Formation</b> in the Kufra Basin consists of shales, which are green, 
      red and light grey at outcrops, and interbedded wavy, rippled or hummocky 
      cross-stratified light grey to reddish-brownish siltstone to fine sandstone 
      beds.<br>
      <br>
      Exposures of this soft shale-dominated unit are rare. Inselbergs, as in the
      <b>Jabal Asba</b> (section M) with exposed shale sections of 29 m, are fortunate 
      exceptions. In most cases, erosion has removed all shales down to a resistant 
      horizon, such as the top Cambro-Ordovician sandstones or fine sandstone interbeds 
      in the upper Tanezzuft succession.<br>
      <br>
      Locally in Jabal Asba, the flat floor consits of greenish shales that represent 
      undefined levels of the Tanezzuft Formation. An exeption is </font>
      <font size="2" color="#FF00FF">section N</font><font size="2" color="#000080"> 
      (Lüning et al.) where the Tanezzuft shales are anomalously thin. Elsewhere, 
      outcrops of the lower part of the Tanezzuft Formation, which are of utmost 
      importance for any source rock evaluation in the Kufra Basin, have not yet 
      been found. It is therefor not surprising that all shale samples collected 
      from the newly measured Tanezzuft sections. The samples originate from the 
      middle and upper parts of the Tanezzuft Formation. One of the few places in 
      the Kufra Basin where the basal part of the Tanezzuft shales has been accessed 
      is the 60 m deep stratigraphic </font><font size="2" color="#FF00FF">well 
      KW-2</font><font size="2" color="#000080">, drilled by AGIP in 1975 in the

      (Lüning et al.). The drilling rig was apparently located on top of the exposed 
      Tanezzuft shale horizon that forms a flat shaly wadi floor at ths locality. 
      Cores in the middle of the shale unit at 18-19 m and 30-31 m apparently yielded 
      the graptolite Climacograptus medius (GRIGAGNI et al. 1991) suggest an Llandoverian 
      age. The top Mamoniyat sandstones lie at a depth of 50 metres.&quot;</font></p>

      &quot;Detailed outcrop studies at the flanks of the Kufra Basin, reveal the nature 
      of glacially-related sedimentation and post-depositional deformation styles 
      produced in association with the Late Ordovician glaciation, during which 
      ice sheets expanded northward over North Africa to deposit the Mamuniyat Formation. 
      At the SE basin flank (<b>Jabal Asba</b>), the Mamuniyat Formation is sand-dominated, 
      and incises interfingering braidplain and shallow marine deposits of the Hawaz 
      Formation. The glacially-related sediments include intercalations of mud-chip 
      bearing tabular sandstones and intraformational conglomerates, which are interpreted 
      as turbidite and debrite facies respectively.<br>
      These record aggradation of an extensive sediment wedge in front of a stable 
      former ice margin. An increase in mudstone content northward is accompanied 
      by the occurrence of more evolved turbidites. A widespread surface, bearing 
      streamlined NW–SE striking ridges and grooves, punctuates this succession. 
      The structures on the surface are interpreted to have formed during a regional 
      north-westward ice advance. Above, siltstones bearing Arthrophycus burrows, 
      and Orthocone-bearing sandstones beneath tidal bars testify to glaciomarine 
      conditions for deposition of the underflow deposits beneath. By contrast, 
      the northern basin margin (<b>Jabal Zalmah</b>) is appreciably different in 
      recording shallower water/paralic sedimentation styles and major glaciotectonic 
      deformation features, although facies analysis also reveals northward deepening. 
      Here, a siltstone wedging from 8 to 50 m toward the north was deposited (lower 
      delta plain), succeeded by climbing ripple cross-laminated sandstones up to 
      60 m in thickness (distal through proximal delta mouth bar deposits) with 
      occasional diamictite interbeds. These rocks are deformed by thrusts and &gt; 
      50 m amplitude fault-propagation folds, the deformation locally sealed by 
      a diamictite then overlain by conglomeratic lag during ultimate deglaciation. 
      Integrating observations from both basin margins, a model of fluvial-dominated 
      delta systems feeding a pulsed debrite and turbidite fan system in a shallow 
      proglacial shelf is proposed.&quot;</font></p>

          Abstract</font></u><font size="2"><br>
          &quot;Fieldwork at the flanks of Al Kufrah Basin, Libya, reveals that Late 
          Ordovician ice sheets were present in the eastern Sahara and that they 
          extended northeastward toward Egypt. Evidence for grounded ice sheets 
          is preserved at the both the southeastern (Jabal Asba) and northern (Jabal 
          Zalmah) basin margins. Characteristic soft-sediment deformation structures, 
          including soft-sediment folds, small-scale faults and striated pavements 
          indicate subglacial shearing and the formation of glacial erosion surfaces. 
          These findings support the presence of a Late Ordovician ice margin in 
          the eastern Sahara and add vital new constraints to reconstructions of 
          the morphology of North African grounded ice sheets. Prior to our study, 
          there existed two plausible models on ice sheet geometry. The first was 
          that separate ice sheets - namely a north and west African ice sheet and 
          an Arabian ice sheet - extended over this part of western North Gondwana. 
          The second was that ice cover was continuous. The presence of a suite 
          of subglacially-generated deformation structures adds considerable credence 
          to the latter interpretation.&quot;</font></font></p>

      &quot;New fieldwork data collected from the flanks of Al Kufrah basin, SE Libya, 
      provide insight into the controls on Siluro-Devonian sedimentation patterns 
      along the eastern part of the North Gondwanan platform. A stratigraphic and 
      sequential correlation framework from the northern and eastern flanks of the 
      basin is presented for the Tanezzuft, Akakus, Tadrart and Binem formations. 
      Ten facies associations are recognised, classified within three process-driven 
      groups, facilitating high-resolution sequence analysis and highlighting key 
      regional unconformities.<br>
      The basal, shaly Tanezzuft formation is organised into a regional transgressive 
      cycle that overlies upper Ordovician glacially-related deposits of the Mamuniyat 
      formation. The shale grade upward into the heterogeneous Akakus formation 
      that comprises complex deltaic thin sandy strata interbedded with silty shale 
      and siltstones, widely influenced by storm to tide related flows. In Jabal 
      Zalmah (northern flank), four 3rd order transgressive–regressive (T/R) depositional 
      sequences were identified, whilst only one in Jabal Asba (eastern flank), 
      indicating significant erosion of the Akakus due to the Caledonian deformation. 
      Depositional cycles are made of sheltered tidal flat deposits which pass upward 
      into lower to upper offshore heterolithic deposits. They are bounded by regional 
      disconformities interpreted as forced regression surfaces. The Silurian Tanezzuft 
      and Akakus formations form together an overall 2nd order regressive succession.<br>
      The Caledonian unconformity is interpreted as a mega-regional sequence boundary 
      resulting from uplift and erosion during the late Silurian into the early 
      Devonian. The thickness variability of the Akakus formation across Al Kufrah 
      basin is strongly indicative of differential erosion which generated a complex 
      basin physiography. Above, the Tadrart formation of lower Devonian age forms 
      an aggrading braided-style fluvial sandy sequence of approximately constant 
      thickness across the basin.<br>
      A return to marine conditions by the mid to late Devonian resulted in deposition 
      of the Binem formation as a series of three stacked 3rd order T/R cycles. 
      These deposits comprise bioturbated, tide-dominated successions which preserve 
      some evidence for periodic open marine flooding. Lying conformably on the 
      Tadrart formation, the Binem formation forms an overall 2nd-order transgressive 
      trend where a maximum flooding surface occurs within the uppermost bioturbated 
      deposits.<br>
      Stratigraphic correlations made on Siluro-Devonian deposits reveal a complex 
      sequential organisation and also account for the impact of the Caledonian 
      erosion on pre-tectonic strata. Post-Caledonian Devonian deposits develop 
      on a smoothed topography associated with a regional uplift and can be easily 
      correlated over the Al Kufrah basin.&quot;</b><br>
