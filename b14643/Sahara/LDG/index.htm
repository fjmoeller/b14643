            <font size="2" color="#000080">The strewn field of the Libyan Desert 
            Glass (LDG) is located in the Western Desert of Egypt nearby the Libyan 
            border (part of the Great Sand Sea). The area is occupies with high 
            parallel sand dunes, which extend from north to south direction more 
            as hundred kilometers in length. As centre is assumed an area, which 
            is expands about 20 km from W to E and about 50 km from N to S around 
            the position at 25° 25&#39; N and 25° 30&#39; E. The occurrence of silica-glass 
            was documented for the first time by Patrick A. Clayton in 1932.<br>
            It is supposed, that on a plain of about 6500 km2 a mass of ~1400 tons 
            of LDG is distributed. The most productive locations therefore are directly 
            in the north of Gilf Kebir plateau.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-right:5">
            <font size="2" color="#000080">The Libyan Desert Glass (LDG) is in its 
            chemical and physical characteristics absolutely unique and with no 
            other natural glass comparable (volcanic glass, tektites and impact 
            glass). Nevertheless should be evidences for an impact origin the presence 
            of schlieren and partly digested mineral phases, and Lechatelierite 
            (a high-temperature mineral melts of quartz, however at slight pressure), 
            and Baddeleyite, a high-temperature breakdown product of Zircon. But 
            the so characteristic inclusions of small crystals of alpha-Tridymite 
            and alpha-Cristobalite are missing in impact glasses. Also typical for 
            tektite are spherical or drops - formed aerodynamic forms.<br>
            There are however also differences between the LDG and the &quot;classical&quot; 
            impact glasses, mainly by the chemistry. LDG is a very silica-rich natural 
            glass with about 95.5 - 99 wt.% SiO2, and shows a limited variation 
            in major and trace element abundances. The degree of hardness (MOHS) 
            is 6, the specific weight is 2.2 g/cm3, the refractive index is 1.46.<br>
            The viscosity is essentially greater than at tektites. The melting point 
            is with 1727-1713° C more as 500° higher, than which other natural glasses. 
            The Desert Glass differs from the Tektites also by higher capacity of 
            water inclusions (0.050 - 0.200 wt.%). The colours of the LDG&#39;s varies 
            from light-yellow, honey-yellow, green-yellow, milky-white to black-grey.<br>
            At the surface deposited fragments are polished often by the wind erosion, 
            in sediment sticking fragments have sharp corners, are not gleaming, 
            and sand grains are stuck. In macroscopic examination, the glass shows 
            no impact tracks (JUX,1983), in some fragments are however schlieren, 
            which point to internal movements in the material at high temperatures.Tiny, 
            irregularly formed bubbles, and light- and dark-brown bands can enforce 
            the homogeneous glassy mass. Is the concentration of bubbles high, the 
            Desert Glass appears milky - white and is opaque. Beside the bubbles 
            different kinds of further inclusions are to be recognized. To this 
            (e.g.) belong smallest crystal-grains of quartz similar minerals alpha-Tridymite 
            and alpha-Cristobalite.</font></p>

            KOEBERL 1997 have found that the contents of siderophile elements, such 
            as Co, Ni and Ir, are significantly enriched in some rare, dark bands 
            that occur in some LDG samples. KOEBERL (1997) studied such dark bands 
            and found that the contents of Fe, Mg, and Ni are high in the dark zones 
            and low in the &quot;normal&quot; LDG. TEM investigation of the dark streaks (PRATESI 
            et al. 2002) also revealed the presence of small amorphous Fe-rich silicate 
            spherules, within the silica-glass matrix, resulting from silicate-silicate 
            liquid immiscibility.</font></p>

            despite all efforts. The majority of specialists favor an origin by 
            an impact. There are however some differences to &quot;classical&quot; impact 
            glasses. There is also no credible references for an impact event in 
            the region. It is also not plausible, that a mass of ~1400 tons of clean 
            glass is produced by an impact event (or an air burst). It is not conceivable, 
            that for a so great quantity of LDG an ground-reservoir of pure silicium-sand 
            was available, which then was melted by an extra-terrestrial event. 
            Besides the desert not exist in the Oligocene age. The surface was dominated 
            by consolidated &quot;Nubian&quot;sandstones.<br>
            It is therefore not to be doubted that the LDG was caused by a purely 
            terrestrial event. Meanwhile, there is enough geological and geochemical 
            evidence for it. An exterrestrial origin (impact or airburst) is excluded, 
            it is nonsense.</font></p>

                Dark streaks and different types of inclusions in Libyan Desert 
                Glass (LDG) collected from the LDG strewn field in Egypt were investigated:<br>
                <br>
                <u>Transparent Spherules</u><br>
                The spherules generally occur as distinct single objects; only rarely 
                two or more are found in close proximity to each other. They are 
                separated from LDG matrix by concentric cracks and contain a high 
                density of internal cracks, which do not extend into the surrounding 
                glass. Sometimes these cracks are curved and delimit rounded subgrains 
                resembling some features of ballen silica, although the rounding 
                of subgrains is not as regular as normally observed in ballen silica. 
                Tiny bubbles are abundant in the spherules and cause partial brownish 
                staining. Viewed with cross polarized light, the spherules appear 
                completely birefringent and show pronounced twin lamellae. Electron 
                microprobe analyses indicate that the spherules have, on average, 
                higher SiO2 (approximately 99.8 wt%) and lower major oxide concentrations 
                (e.g., Al2O3, MgO, FeO, and TiO2) than the surrounding LDG glass. 
                Accordingly, they appear slightly darker in BSE images compared 
                to LDG matrix. Raman spectra recorded on various spherules show 
                pronounced peaks at 230 and 418 cm<sup>-1</sup> and smaller peaks 
                at 780 and 1076 cm<sup>-1</sup>, which are diagnostic for
                <font color="#FF0000"><b>alpha-cristobalite</b></font>. In some 
                spectra the peak at 780 cm<sup>-1</sup> is shifted to 793 cm<sup>-1</sup>, 
                which might be attributed to the intense twinning.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                <u>Brownish Inclusions&nbsp; (<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Al-rich 
                orthopyroxene<font color="#FF0000">* </font></span>)</u><br>
                &quot;Brownish inclusions are irregularly shaped, elongated objects that 
                exhibit smooth contacts to the surrounding glass, with schlieren 
                extending from the inclusions into the glass matrix. Optical microscopy 
                reveals that the inclusions are composed of numerous very small 
                bubbles causing the brownish color and of subrounded to rounded 
                mineral grains displaying higher refractive indices than the surrounding 
                glass. While some of these phases appear as small roundish to elliptical 
                droplets, a few larger and more angular grains exist. Generally, 
                all phases within the inclusions appear isotropic when viewed under 
                cross polarized light.<br>
                Electron microprobe analysis revealed that angular grains and droplets 
                have very similar chemical compositions. All these phases contain 
                considerable amounts of silica (approximately 5354 wt% SiO2) with 
                approximately 56 wt% Al2O3, approximately 2324 wt% MgO, approximately 
                1415 wt% FeO, and minor concentrations of TiO2, Cr2 O3, MnO, and 
                CaO. Analyses also indicate poor stoichiometry of the phases attesting 
                to a low degree of crystallinity. These compositions most closely 
                resemble that of an Al-rich orthopyroxene.<br>
                According to X-ray elemental mapping, the angular grains and droplets 
                are compositionally homogeneous and do not show any chemical zoning. 
                Due to the high porosity of the two birefringent grains, their electron 
                microprobe analyses are also nonstoichiometric and yielded totals 
                between 95.5 and 99.1 wt%. Although containing slightly less Al 
                than the droplets, the overall composition of the birefringent grains 
                closely resembles that of the isotropic grains and droplets. Raman 
                spectra obtained from the different isotropic grains and droplets 
                are characterized by two broad features at approximately 570 and 
                960 cm<sup>-1</sup> attesting to their amorphous nature or very 
                low degree of crystallinity.<br>
                In contrast, Raman spectra collected from the birefringent grains 
                show several distinct peaks, which are clearly recognizable despite 
                a strong fluorescence. The most prominent Raman bands are found 
                at ~340, ~385, ~464, ~655, ~674, ~839, ~935, and ~1001 cm<sup>-1</sup>. 
                According to systematic Raman studies of pyroxenes, these bands, 
                especially the splitting of the doublet in the 650680 cm<sup>-1</sup> 
                region, are typical for <b>orthopyroxene</b>.<br>
                Compositions and Raman spectra clearly indicate that all pyroxene-like 
                phases observed in the brownish inclusions were at least partially 
                molten....and that no low-Ca, Al-rich pyroxene phenocrysts are present 
                in the glassy groundmass. Hence, the pyroxene-like phases are clearly 
                not co-genetic.&quot;<br>
                <br>
                <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><font color="#FF0000">*</font> 
                Pyroxenes occur dominantly in rocks formed under high ambient pressure, 
                e.g., in a hypersthene-cordierite-biotite granulite, in granulite 
                xenoliths from the lower continental crust, and in a bronzite from 
                a high-pressure megacryst in an alkaline lava. </span><br>
                <br>
                <u>Dark Streaks</u><br>
                &quot;The dark streaks investigated in this study appear as 0.3 to about 
                1 mm wide wavy bands that continue for about 13 cm almost parallel 
                within the light greenish glass fragment. Intensity of the brownish 
                staining varies locally from weak to strong over several millimeters. 
                Optical microscopy revealed that these bands resemble turbulent 
                flow structures that do not contain any discernable mineral phases 
                at the millimeter scale. Differently shaped bubbles are quite abundant 
                within the streaks and sometimes appear as nucleation sites for 
                the bands. In high contrast BSE images the streaks are clearly discernable 
                and appear as curved, variably gray-colored bands or as lenticular 
                regions with pronounced flow textures. Electron microprobe analyses 
                and X-ray elemental mapping of several regions within streaks show 
                a strongly heterogeneous distribution of Al, Si, Mg, andmore rarely 
                and less pronouncedof Fe and Ti. Generally, the Si-rich regions 
                appear darker in BSE imaging, whereas those with higher Al and Mg 
                contents are brighter. Variations in Al abundances allow tracking 
                the flow structures observed in BSE mode.<br>
                The Micro-XRF mapping clearly shows enrichments and good correlation 
                of the abundances of Mn, Cr, Fe, and Ni in the dark streaks. The 
                Ti-distribution also shows pronounced schlieren structures, which 
                appear, however, not related to the Fe maximum intensity. The Zr 
                distribution map shows the presence of distinct Zr-rich spots, probably 
                zircon or baddeleyite. <br>
                The concentrations of the elements Cr, Mn, and Ni were extrapolated 
                using the linear correlation of peak intensity and element concentration 
                determined in different standards and should be taken as semi-quantitative. 
                The concentrations for dark and light areas, respectively, are for 
                Ti 920 and 780 ppm and for Fe 4900 and 1160 ppm. In the dark streaks 
                the concentration of Cr is 170 ppm, that for Mn 74 ppm, and for 
                Ni 80 ppm; the concentrations of these elements are below the detection 
                limit in the light regions.<br>
                Raman spectra recorded from the dark streaks are featureless and 
                confirm that no crystalline phase is present in the bands.&quot;</font></td>

            are assigned to degenerated vibration modes of the (SiO4) tetrahedral

            for amorphous phases. The wave number of the m Si-O band is affected

            silica phases (e.g., quartz, cristobalite, opal-CT), it is regarded 
            as the envelope of several, poorly resolved bands; then <i>delta</i> 
            n and <i>I</i> are less significant than for amorphous phases. For LDG

            The absorbance, the half-width, and the integrated intensity vary rather

            The relative motion results in a deformation of the Si-O-Si angle in 
            the direction of its bissectrix (Parke 1974).&quot;<br>

            </font><font size="2">&quot;In polished thin sections, LDG appears as a homogeneous 
            glass with spherical bubbles and mainly tubular cavities. Sometimes 
            they are at least partly filled with sand grains and/or hardened silt. 
            The millimeter-sized (and smaller) whitish polycrystalline spherical 
            inclusions visible inside the LDG volume were identified by FTIR (and 
            also by Raman spectroscopy) as cristobalite concentrations. Other mineral 
            inclusions were detected by SEM in BSE mode (backscattered electrons) 
            and determined by EDS. These included melted crystals (deduced on the 
            basis of their elliptical form) of monazite, a rare earth element (REE) 
            phosphate depleted or totally lacking in phosphorus as seen on their 
            EDS spectra, according to the three domains analyzed (in wt%: Al = 0.20.8%, 
            Si = 15.026.0%, O = 36.237.0%, P = &lt;0.19.0%, Ca = &lt;0.10.4%, La =

            </font><font size="2">&quot;Samples of Libyan Desert Glass were analyzed 
            by X-ray micro-diffraction technique. It was identified fourteen nano-sized 
            crystalline LDG phases with different colours: <u>Coesite, tridymite, 
            stishovite</u>, baddeleyite, huttonite, yttrium, moissanite, platinium,
            <u>polymorphs of diamond and graphite</u>.<br>
            The four praphite polymorh phases found in LDG samples can be explained 
            by taking into account that the graphite came from the earlier history 
            of the material. The element platinum is extremely scarce in most crustal 
            rocks. The origin of platinum is from ultra-mafic igneous rocks. Its 
            melting point is 1775 °C. The zircon oxide mineral Baddeleyite is the 
            product of the decomposition of zircon at 1775° - 1900°C. Moissanite 
            is a natural silicon carbide (SiC). Huttonite is a low-temperature and 
            low-pressure Thorite-polymorph (ThSiO2).<br>
            The identification of nine highbaric phases, the <u>presence of hexagonal 
            diamond with four phases of graphite polymorphs</u>, as well as huttonite 
            and baddeleyite, confirm that LDG formed by &quot;shock metamorphism&quot; at 
            very high pressure and temperature. The nano-sized crystalline phases 
            revealed point out that LDG rapidly solidified.<br>
            Preliminary X-ray micro-diffractometry analyses were presented at the 
            Silica 96 workshop (Patuelli, 1997). High pressure and high temperature 
            phases were identified: including samarium, germanium 12T, thorium beta 
            (this beta phase occurs only at a temperature above 1350°C) and stishovite, 
            which is a high temperature and pressure form of SiO2.&quot;<br>

            &quot;Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) investigation of the dark (brown 
            or bluish) streaks occurring in Libyan Desert Glass reveals the common 
            presence of <u>small glass spherules</u>. The spherules, mostly 100 
            nm in size, are homogeneously dispersed within the silica-glass matrix. 
            The complete absence of electron diffraction effects confirms their 
            amorphous nature. The spherules are Al-, Fe- and Mg-enriched with respect 
            to the surrounding silica matrix and their (Mg+Al+Fe) : Si ratio is 
            close to 1. The silica-glass matrix and amorphous spherules form an 
            emulsion texture (i.e., globules of one glass in a matrix of another 
            glass), which originates from silicate-silicate liquid immiscibility.<br>
            The silica glass also contains carbonaceous inclusions consisting of 
            550 nm thick, <u>polygonalized graphite ribbons</u> that form closed 
            structures up to 200 nm in diameter.<br>
            <br>
            <b><u>3.3. Graphite inclusions</u></b><br>
            Rare carbon-bearing inclusions randomly occur within the silica-glass 
            matrix. Their presence is ubiquitous and not limited to the regions 
            with dark streaks. C-bearing inclusions produce an evident C peak in 
            the EDS spectra. The inclusions consist of ring-shaped polygonalized 
            ribbons, 550 nm thick, typically forming closed structures with an 
            overall diameter of ~200 nm. Their SAED patterns consist of rings with 
            d-spacings of 3.35, 2.09 and 1.67 A: these values correspond to graphite 
            (3.36, 2.13-2.03, 1.678 A, JCPDS 23-64). Lattice imaging shows 3.35 
            A polygonized (002) lattice fringes. The fringes are quite regular, 
            thus indicating good structural order with no evidence of deformation 
            or defects. Dark vertical bands are evident at the polygonal edges and 
            are interpreted as Moire textures.&quot;</font></p>

            </font><font size="2">&quot;In this study we have focused on the chemical 
            and textural characteristics of dark schlieren. Our investigation aims 
            at obtaining further information on the cooling history and precursor 
            material of LDG.<br>
            Backscattered electron (BSE) images were taken on the SEM and microprobe 
            in order to monitor chemical variations in LDG and to detect tiny inclusions. 
            Schlieren-free, bulk LDG samples show only slight variations in chemistry, 
            with two different grayscales in BSE images. Dark grey, lens-like areas 
            consist of almost pure SiO2 and thus represent lechatelierite, the melt 
            product of quartz. Bright grey areas have on average a SiO2 content 
            of 98  99 wt.%; additional minor elements are Mg, Fe, Al, Ca, K, and 
            Na. <br>
            Compared to the bulk glass, the brownish-black schlieren in LDG are 
            distinctly enriched in Mg, Fe, and Al; the concentrations of measured 
            trace elements such as Ti, Ni, Cr, and La are equally enhanced. In some 
            parts of schlieren the SiO2 content decreases down to 86 wt %. Within 
            the dark schlieren we observe furthermore distinctly larger chemical 
            variations than in the bulk glass sample. <br>
&nbsp;BSE images indicate that there are two types of dark schlieren. One type of 
            dark schlieren consists exclusively of tiny, mostly 100 nm in size, 
            glass spherules. This type of schlieren have been previously described 
            in a transmission electron microscopy study, as well. In comparison 
            to the glass matrix, the spherules are enriched in Al, Fe, Mg, and Ni 
            and depleted in Ca. <br>
            The other type of dark schlieren displays flow structures and large, 
            up to 25 &#956;m diameter glass spherules. The overall texture of these schlieren 
            indicates an immiscibility of two silicate liquids. To detect the miscibility 
            gap, the chemical compositions of spherules and the surrounding groundmass 
            in dark schlieren have been measured with the microprobe and are plotted 
            in a ternary MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 diagram. The analytical data define a trend 
            that deviates from the known stable miscibility gap along the MgO-SiO2 
            join. Instead, the data points follow closely the Al2O3-SiO2 tie line, 
            along which a metastabile miscibility gap has been described. <br>
            Microprobe analyses of spherules and ground-mass in dark schlieren of 
            LDG. The ternary plot shows also the known stable miscibility gap along 
            the MgO-SiO2 join. <br>
            LDG samples with and without black schlieren were stepwisely heated 
            up to 1450°C. In both samples, bursting bubbles released mostly H2O 
            and CO2. The black schlieren contain however one order of magnitude 
            more H2O and CO2 than the bulk silica glass. Another difference between 
            black schlieren and bulk glass concerns the temperatures of gas release. 
            For example, CO2 is released from black schlieren in two temperature 
            intervals between 250° - 300°C and 450° - 550°C. In the bulk sample, 
            CO2 is however only liberated in the upper temperature interval between 
            420° - 650°C. <br>

            </font><u><font size="2">The data presented here provide hints to the 
            cooling history of LDG and the precursor material of dark schlieren. 
            Microprobe data of glass spherules and surrounding matrix in dark schlieren 
            indicate that the compositions of the two immiscible silicate liquids 
            are close to the Al2O3-SiO2 join. According to experimental studies, 
            this binary system displays only metastable immiscibility for very rapid 
            cooling of the melt, as it is expected for LDG. </font>

      of inclusions trapped inside Libyan Desert Glass by Raman microscopy</font><br>
      </b><font size="2">Marcel Swaenen, Elzbieta Anna Stefaniak, Ray Frost, Anna 
      Worobiec and Rene Van Grieken -- Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry, 397 
      (7), pp.2659-2665<br>
      <br>
      &quot;Several specimens of Libyan Desert Glass (LDG), an enigmatic natural glass 
      from Egypt, were subjected to investigation by micro-Raman spectroscopy. The 
      spectra of inclusions inside the LDG samples were successfully measured through 
      the layers of glass and the mineral species were identified on this basis. 
      The presence of cristobalite as typical for high-temperature melt products 
      was confirmed, together with co-existing quartz. TiO2 was determined in two 
      polymorphic species, rutile and anatase. Micro- Raman spectroscopy proved 
      also the presence of minerals unusual for high-temperature glasses such as 
      anhydrite and aragonite.</font><b><br>
      </b><font size="2"><br>
      As it was mentioned before, MRS is very convenient to analyse inclusions in 
      transparent samples without damaging them. First we measured Raman activity 
      of glassy matrix.<br>
      Fig. 2 shows a piece of LDG together with a Raman spectrum of its bulk material. 
      Such a spectrum has been previously published. The glassy matrix does not 
      give a distinct Raman spectrum, just irregular background. However, a closer 
      look at the spectrum in Fig. 2 allows us to distinguish some vibrational bands, 
      also described elsewhere. Two typical broad bands  one around 480 cm-1 and 
      the other at 820 cm-1  are typical for glassy silicate materials. The range 
      400-600 cm-1 is ascribed to bending in and between the SiO4 tetrahedra associated 
      with cationic motions; the range near 800 cm-1 is the symmetric motion of 
      adjacent Si atoms with respect to a bridging oxygen (Si-O-Si) .......<br>
      The Raman band marked with a red arrow (Fig. 2) should be emphasised, hence 
      this sharp (although not intense) peak would indicate the presence of fullerene. 
      It was a small black spot deep under the surface; however we managed to record 
      the spectrum. Although it seemed quite incredible for us that fullerenes could 
      be found inside LDG, it has already been mentioned in the literature.<br>
      Figs. 3 to 8 present the other inclusions analysed by MRS. Cristobalite is 
      the silica form most often reported as a component of LDG. It is widely assumed 
      that its presence proves the temperature of glass quenching as above 1470°C. 
      The shape of cristobalite inclusion presented in <b>Fig. 3</b> is typical 
      for LDG, with an almost ideally spherical form. However, we also found cristobalite 
      as crushed, irregularly shaped inclusions (Fig. 3). Moreover, its Raman spectrum 
      is fairly disturbed by luminescence, probably due to a presence of transition 
      metals or REE. As for other polymorphs of silica, tridymite is stable below 
      1470°C and above 870°C, while quartz  below 870°. However, the presence of 
      one form does not exclude the other one, which is clearly shown in <b>Fig. 
      4</b>. The Raman spectrum gives an undeniable confirmation of quartz being 
      present in LDG; the question remains whether it is a primary or secondary 
      mineral. In a cristobalite structure, each SiO4 tetrahedron shares its oxygen 
      atoms with adjacent tetrahedra; how likely it is then to convert cristobalite 
      into quartz within 29 million years? A similar system of two TiO2 polymorphs 
      is presented in <b>Fig. 5</b> and <b>Fig. 6</b>. Rutile is a common accessory 
      mineral formed in high-temperature and high-pressure metamorphic rocks. Anatase 
      (and brookite) are less stable and revert to rutile at low temperatures (anatase 
      at 915°C and brookite at 750°C). Considering that both rutile and anatase 
      can be found as LDG inclusions, it leads to a doubt whether the temperature 
      of cooling down was indeed so extremely high.<br>
      The spectrum shown in <b>Fig. 6</b> belongs to zircon  a mineral also recognized 
      as inclusion of LDG, however more often as a precursor of baddeleite (ZrO2), 
      which is a product of thermal decomposition of ZrSiO4. In our investigation 
      we didn&#39;t find any traces of baddeleite, but we definitely confirmed the presence 
      of zircon, which would speak in favour of rather low or medium temperature 
      of quenching.<br>
      The inclusion in <b>Fig. 7</b> was quite surprising as well. It is composed 
      of at least two different phases  the white one, which MRS spectrum was only 
      a big fluorescence hump, and the brownish one, which apparently contains amorphous 
      carbon. MRS spectra in Fig. 7 represent different spots within the brown area. 
      The two characteristic D and G band shape proves doubtlessly that carbon was 
      there, but it doesn&#39;t give any explanation how organic matter could be preserved 
      in hot molten silica.&quot;</font></p>

          Macroscopically analyzed LDG are translucent glassy matrix with brownish 
          spherical inclusions located all over the external surface before slicing. 
          However, after the lamination of the samples, it could be observed that 
          in the inner part the brownish inclusions were not discerned, whereas 
          whitish inclusions could be easily perceived. Microscopically, it could 
          be noticed little dark inclusions.<br>
          Raman spectroscopy allows determining the mineral phases of the inclusions. 
          Comparing the results obtained from the inclusions of the surface and 
          those obtained from the inner inclusions, it could be noticed important 
          differences.<br>
          Apart from the silica mineral phases such as cristobalite and quartz, 
          other minerals were found in the inclusions distributed through the matrix 
          of the LDG. In the inclusions located on the surface of the samples iron 
          compounds were not detected, whereas they are the main component of the 
          inner ones. In contrast, compound such as corundum is only present at 
          the surface.<br>
          Besides, they were identified mineral characteristic phases of the LDG 
          (high pressure) and of LDG settled state (low pressure). The presence 
          of calcite suggests a possible transformation of high pressure aragonite 
          to the low pressure calcite both detected in the present study.<br>
          Other couples of minerals similar in composition are also detected. In 
          this way, sulphates as anhydrite and gypsum were detected. Anhydrite corresponds 
          to the anhydrous phase of gypsum. During weathering, hematite can be transformed 
          into a mixture of hydrated iron oxide-hydroxide known as limonite.<br>
          In the case of silicates, the identified cristobalite could be formed 
          during high temperature, since it is a hightemperature mineral; in contrast 
          quartz is the cristobalite low-temperature polymorph. High temperature 
          mineral phases such as microcline and anatase were distinguished.<br>
          By Raman spectroscopy respective low temperature polymorphs were not found. 
          However, by optical microscopy of fine rutile microlites can be observed. 
          This phase can correspond to the transition of the anatase with high temperature.<br>
          In order to complement the previous results it was carried out an element 
          mapping using SEM-EDS. In this way it could be seen how the elements are 
          distributed in the inclusions. In Fig. 1 the first image is corresponded 
          with the SEM image of an inclusion of LDG. The other images are elemental 
          maps done with EDS over the same inclusion. In those maps, the white colour 
          represents the presence of an element and the black the absence. It can 
          be seen that the inclusions are not formed by only one compound. The inclusion 
          analyzed in the image, around the big cavity, is composed mainly by silicon 
          but some elements are concentrated in certain areas, such as: C, O, Mg, 
          Al, K, Ca, Ti and Fe.<br>
          On the one hand, calcium and carbon maps are very similar. The place where 
          the carbon and the calcium are more concentrated is the same. This fact 
          supports the presence of calcite and/or aragonite, both determined by 
          Raman.<br>
          On the other hand, silicon, iron and aluminium compounds appear similarly 
          place and are in concordance the mineralogy detected by Raman spectroscopy. 
          This chemical and mineralogical heterogeneity was observed in all the 
          analyzed samples.<br>
          This work is an approach to the knowledge of the origin of the Libyan 
          Desert Glass. It can be concluded that the silica is the main component 
          in LDG glassy matrix. Inclusions are composed by different compounds and 
          therefore are chemically more heterogeneous.<span style="font-size: 9.0pt">&quot;</span></font></td>
