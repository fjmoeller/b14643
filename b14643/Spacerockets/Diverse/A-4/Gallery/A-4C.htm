  <p align="left"><font color="#000080" size="2">Further to the first prototype 
  of the aggregat 4 were produced two series: Series A as a pure development vehicle 
  and the series B for use as a weapon. The development of the series C was to follow. 
  The fuel injection system of series A and B of A-4 consisted of a cluster with 
  18 single mixing heads, which were arranged on a combustion chamber. The planned 
  series C should have a common mixing head. It also was the intention, the A-4 
  alternatively from Alcohol + LOX propellant completely convert to Diesel-oil + 
  Nitric Acid operation.</font></p>

  The new common mixing head on the combustion chamber consists of a large centrally-mounted

  </font><font size="2" color="#000080">Based on a better atomization and mixing 
  of the fuel in the combustion chamber was expected a pressure of 40 atm, opposed 
  to 13-14 atm in the 18 mixing head &quot;Ofen&quot;. The higher pressure would mean, lower 
  fuel consumption as well as longer burning time and 270 km reach more.<br>
&nbsp;With the use of&nbsp; Diesel-oil + Nitric Acid, instead of Alcohol + LOX, 
  based on first calculations, was expected a reach of 430 km, later up to 550 km.<br>
  After examination of the initial considerations, the A-4 to fuel with the increase 
  weight of Diesel-oil + Nitric Acid propellant, it was extrapolated that the A-4 
  in the launch phase had to low initial acceleration. Therefore should the construction 
  of the A-4 rocket to be changed, and then a 40atü 300 kN &quot;Ofen&quot; as standard engine 
  get.</font><font size="2"><br>

  <p><font color="#000080" size="2">&nbsp;On Aug. 25, 1941 the first time a common 
  mixing head &quot;Ofen&quot; burned on the test stand. A pressure of 10 atm and a thrust 
  of 40 kN were measured. A common mixing head &quot;Ofen&quot; with 40 atm and 400 kN thrust 
  was in the building.<br>
  <br>
  Planned for the A-4 of the series C was a switch to alternative materials. This 
  was not realized, because the common mixing head “Ofen” not the production line 
  had reached. Instead of common mixing head “Ofen” was the 18 single mixing head 
  “Ofen” -- it was manufactured in the A series by aluminum -- used in the B series 
  but of steel. This was not screwed now but welded with the combustion chamber.<br>
