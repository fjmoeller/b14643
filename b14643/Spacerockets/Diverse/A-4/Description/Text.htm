    <b>German ballistic missile Aggregat 4 (A-4)<br>
    </b>The A-4 ballistic missile was the world&#39;s first operational liquid fuel 
    rocket. Development of the rocket engine for the A-4 was also be deviled with 
    difficulties. The A-4 would need an engine of 25 tonnes thrust. Eventually, 
    through a seven-year process of trial and error, a fuel-cooled rocket engine 
    of 1.5 tonnes thrust and a specific impulse of 215 seconds was perfected. But 
    all attempts to scale this engine up to the 25 tonnes thrust required for the 
    A-4 met insurmountable combustion instability problems. Finally an interim solution 
    to produce test A-4 missiles was found - clustering 18 of the 1.5 tonne combustion 
    chambers, feeding into a common mixing chamber. In fact this immensely complex 
    &#39;interim&#39; design had to be pressed into production.<br>
    Development of the aerodynamics and control systems for the A-4 took hundreds 
    of tests&nbsp; in wind tunnels, air-drops, and powered flights. This was also 
    a grueling trial and error process, for there was little theory and no practical 
    experience in supersonic aerodynamics. A missile had to be controlled when rising 
    vertically at near zero speed, where aerodynamic surfaces would be ineffective. 
    Then it had to remain controllable and stable at subsonic, transonic, and supersonic 
    speeds up to Mach 4. It was not until mid-1942, ten years after development 
    had started, that the first test A-4 was launched. But at least it was shown 
    that the long development process had produced workable aerodynamic and control 
    solutions.<br>
    The turbopumps to feed the propellants to the engines proved relatively easy 
    - to <b>Wernher von Braun</b>&#39;s surprise, high-volume low-weight pumps were 
    already well developed for fire engines. The other structural elements were 
    well within the allowable mass.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="-1">The final area of completely 
new technology was the guidance system. How could a missile with a range of 320 
km be guided accurately to its target? It seemed only a radio beam guidance system 
could provide the necessary accuracy, but the A-4 developers had to take a backseat 
to development of such systems for the German bomber and interceptor forces. Therefore 
they settled for a control system that oriented the missile along a pre-determined 
path in a vertical plane pointed at the target. The system used accumulating accelerometers 
to determine when the missile had reached the correct velocity and then cut off 
the engine. It was thought that this would provide sufficient accuracy, although 
operations would indicate otherwise.<br>
Hitler delayed the decision to put the A-4 into production for three years, from 
1939 to 1942. However, given the difficulties in the development of the A-4, this 
seems doubtful. Even with the 1942 go-ahead, the A-4 was nowhere near a production 
design. Getting it into production concurrently with development was a nearly insurmountable 
problem - 65,000 changes were made to the initial production drawings. Tests of 
the first production missiles began in early 1944. Mysterious in-flight disintegrations 
of the missiles resulted in an 80% failure rate. These were found to have multiple 
causes, and the last of the several fixes to the missile was not introduced in the 
production line until November 1944.<br>

German winged boost-glide Aggregat 4 (A-4b)</b><br>
</font></font><font size="2" color="#000080">In early 1941 it was clear the final 
aerodynamic shape of the A-4 glider. It was refers A4-V12/c (later A-9). For testing 
a smaller scaled version was made. This construction was given the project-designation 
A-7. But even in the same year 1941, ended by order further testing on the A7/A9.<br>
But in June 1944, the project could continue. In October 1944 suggested Wernher 
von Brown to build a new variant. There should be builded a &quot;bastard&quot; with parts 
of the A-4 and A-9, the A-4b. One of the beneficial changes is the replace the fuel 
container made of aluminum, with a container of &quot;Mipolan&quot; impregnated cotton. In 
this configuration was launched on Dec. 27, 1944 the first A-4b “Bastard”. The next 
A-4b &quot;Bastard&quot; was launched successful on Jan. 24, 1945. The difference between 
A-9 and A-4b is easily discernible on the control-wings. Contrary to the A-9 at 
the A-4b was used a standard A-4 tail with small additional control-wings.<b><br>

U.S. experimental rocket A-4</b> <br>
Between April 16, 1946 and September 19, 1952 General Electric launched 63 rockets 
from the White Sands Proving Grounds. A rhesus monkey named Albert became the first 
animal to flyby in a rocket when he was launched in a USAF A-4 rocket in 1948.<br>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080" size="2">Six of 
the V2 launches were as the first stage of the Bumper rocket. The WAC Corporal was 
used as an upper stage on the V2, producing Americas first large multi-staged rocket. 
This combination was named Bumper, and reached an altitude of 405 kilometers on 
February 24, 1949.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080" size="2">The rocket 
WAC Corporal was to carry 11 kg of instrumentation to an altitude of at least 30 
km. The WAC Corporal was boosted into the air by a Tiny Tim 11.75&quot; solid-fueled 
rocket, and powered by a liquid-fueled sustainer engine. The nose cone was designed 
to separate near the end of the flight, releasing a parachute for instrument recovery.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2">I</font><font size="2" color="#000080">n 
May 1948 that year the first Bumper was launched. It had only a dummy upper stage 
with a small solid-propellant charge to test stage separation, and did achieve its 
objectives. The first flight with a live Bumper WAC (the third one) occurred on 
30 September 1948, but failed because the WAC&#39;s engine exploded on ignition. A design 
deficiency was tracked down and corrected, and (after a A-4 failure in November), 
the fifth Bumper flight on 24 February 1949 was the first full success. In that 
day, the upper stage reached an altitude of 393 km.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080" size="2">After 
a A-4 failure on the sixth flight, it was decided that the remaining two Bumpers 
would be used to fly the Bumper WAC as fast as possible to produce aerodynamic data 
at unprecedented speeds. On the first launch of an RV-A-4 at the new launch site&nbsp; 
Cape Canaveral, the upper stage failed to ignite, but the second and final attempt 
on 29 July 1950 was successful and the Bumper WAC reached a speed of 5,260 km/h.<br>

<b>U.S. experimental A-4 Ramjet rocket</b></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080" size="2">The Ramjet 
rocket consisted of a A-4, which had a ramjet-powered second stage (called &quot;Ram&quot;) 
mounted semi-recessed on top. The &quot;Ram&quot; was a small vehicle with large wedge-shaped 
wings, which actually housed small rectangular-section ramjet units. The A-4 first 
stage had enlarged fins to improve stability of the whole missile. The rocket was 
launched into an arched trajectory, and after burnout of the A-4 engine, the &quot;Ram&quot; 
was to be separated from the A-4 by diffential aerodynamic drag. As soon as the 
&quot;Ram&quot; was no longer climbing, the ramjet units were to ignite and propel the vehicle 
to a speed of about 1000 m/s. The &quot;Ram&quot; was to carry a newly developed advanced 
gyro-inertial stabilization and guidance system. The first flight of a A-4 Ramjet 
occurred in May 1947, and used only a mockup &quot;Ram&quot; with dummy (non-burning) ramjets 
to measure dynamic pressures in the ramjet ducts. Although the flight was unsuccessful. 
The three remaining flights eventually occurred in January 1949, October 1949 and 
November 1950, but it is unclear whether the three latter flights carried a &quot;Ram&quot; 
with live ramjets and/or released the &quot;Ram&quot; into free flight.<br>

Soviet experimental rocket R-1A</font></b></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font size="2" color="#000080">To mature mass and operating characteristics of rocket 
R-1, its designers proposed to use an integral fuel tank and a warhead separated 
from the rocket at the ascent phase completion. In this case, only the ascent phase 
appeared to be rated for the launch vehicle and considerably more favorable regarding 
mechanical and thermal loads as compared to the atmospheric portion of the descent 
phase of the flight trajectory. To verify experimentally those new ideas, mainly 
to investigate peculiar features of the warhead separation process at the ascent 
phase completion, rocket R-1A has been developed. However, since many organizations 
showed interest in using the new rocket for their purposes, the experiment program 
fell far beyond the original plan.<br>
Rocket R-1A became the first rocket to carry science equipment in recoverable containers 
to upper atmospheric layers (the containers were located in a section of the rocket 
stabilizers). The solution to separate the warhead turned to be so good that it 
was employed in all subsequent domestic rockets. To measure physical parameters 
in the upper rarefied atmosphere, rocket R-1A was already provided with the instrumentation 
system conventionally named &quot;FIAN-1&quot;. </font></p>

<font size="2" color="#000080">Soviet geophysical rockets R-1B, R-1W, R-1D and R-1E</font></b></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" color="#000080">The first 
geophysical experiments have been accommodated. The obtained data served as a basis 
to work out a large geophysical research program pursuing interests of the Academy 
of Sciences of the USSR and designers of modified rocket R-1 intended for that purpose 
(R-1B, R-1V, R-1D, R-1E).<br>
All four launches of rocket <b>R-1B</b> that took place in July - August 1951 were 
vertical with one launch failed. The rocket carried experimental animals accommodated 
in a special pressurized compartment to study their behavior in space environment. 
On July 1951 dogs Dezik and Tsygan were the first to successfully fly on rocket 
R-1B.<br>
Rocket&nbsp; <b>R-1</b> <b>W</b> differed from R-1B only in that the FIAN-1 equipment 
was replaced by a parachute system to recover the rocket body. In total, two launches 
have been carried out in July - August 1951.<br>
Unlike rockets R-1B and R-1V where experimental animals had to be returned in a 
pressurized compartment on a parachute, on rocket <b>R-1D</b> each of the two dogs 
was catapulted in a space suit mounted on a special cradle provided with a parachute 
system and a Life Support System. In addition, on rocket R-1D, instead of the FIAN-1 
compartment, science hardware was accommodated to study vertical distribution of 
ionization density in ionosphere and propagation of super long waves in atmosphere 
and space. All three launches of rocket R-1D that took place in June-August 1951 
were successful. <br>
Through launches of rocket <b>R-1E</b> one more attempt has been made to solve the 
rocket body recovery problem. For this purpose, three powder boosters were provided 
on the warhead to impart a separation velocity of about 12 m/s to it. However, this 
was not sufficient enough. A new constructive option of the rocket body return system 
implied the use of a pyro gun that had not only to activate pilot chutes, but also 
simultaneously release parachute packages containing main cupolas. Totally, from 
January 1955 to April 1956, six launches have been carried out of which four were 
successful. </font></p>
