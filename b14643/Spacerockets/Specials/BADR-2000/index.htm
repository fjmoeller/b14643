      <p><font color="#000080" size="2">Beginning in 1984/1985, Iraq started a cooperative 
      effort with Egypt and Argentina to develop a high-technology, two-stage missile 
      system designed for a range of around 1,000 km, called BADR-2000 in Iraq, 
      Vector in Egypt and <b>
      <a target="_blank" href="../../../Spacerockets_1/Rest_World/Aguila-LSA/Description/Frame.htm">
      Condor-II</a></b> in Argentina. This missile was to be built first as a two-stage.<br>
      Iraq declared that, in the beginning of 1989, it attempted to complete the 
      BADR-2000 project by itself, in particular the production of solid propellant 
      motors In fact, the only BADR-2000 missiles delivered to Iraq were two mock-ups 
      of the complete missile that were to be used for training. The BADR-2000 Junior 
      is a single-stage version, which was developed after the death of the BADR-2000.<br>
      <br>
      Post the war Iraq continued to work on the SRBM system with ranges of less 
      than 150 km authorized by the United Nations.<br>
      Personnel previously involved with the BADR-2000 missile are working now on 
      the smaller Al-Fat&#39;h missile. The Al-Fat&#39;h uses probably the rocket motor 
      of Argentina&#39;s Condor-I (Alacran) as a replica.<br>
      <br>
      The BADR-2000, as described in the concept definition report, was to be a 
      mobile, twostage, medium-range, surface-to-surface, ballistic missile system 
      with a separating reentry vehicle as payload. The system included the missile 
      itself and all equipment concerned with transport and handling, firing position 
      survey, trajectory computation, launch preparation, missile launch, command 
      communication, checkout and power supplies as well as service and support 
      equipment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Boost stage rocket motor</b><br>
      The first stage boost rocket was 800mm in diameter with a maraging steel case, 
      filled with cast composite HTPB propellant. At the time Iraq negotiated their 
      contract with the foreign country, the design for this motor had already been 
      established.<br>
      Thrust vectoring for missile control in pitch and yaw during the boost phase 
      was to be provided by a flexible-joint nozzle with hydraulically operated 
      actuators powered by pressurized stored helium gas. The flexible-joint nozzle 
      was an advanced design, using alternating rings of elastomeric material (natural 
      rubber) and steel reinforcements to allow articulation of the nozzle at the 
      throat region.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Second stage rocket engine</b><br>
      The second stage rocket engine, according to the contract, was to be based 
      on an existing, third-party liquid propellant engine (LPE) using MMH (monomethyl 
      hydrazine) as fuel and nitrogen tetroxide as oxidiser, each stored in two 
      separate pressurized tanks. At the end of the Concept Definition Phase, the 
      propellants were listed as UDMH (unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine) as fuel 
      and MON 7 (mixed oxides of nitrogen) as oxidizer. A gimbaled nozzle, actuated 
      by compact electro-mechanical units, would provide thrust vector control. 
      The maximum burn time for the engine was 40 seconds.<br>
      The engine is shut down by two valves that are pyrotechnically activated by 
      the guidance and control package when the missile has attained the required 
      velocity for the selected range. Although a second stage engine design was 
      apparently available to the missile design team at the time of signing the 
      contract, further development work was required and design modifications were 
      carried out in the concept definition phase. During the sustain phase, roll 
      control of the second stage vehicle is provided by the cold gas thruster system 
      housed in the re-entry vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      It is clear that, from the outset of its negotiations with the foreign country, 
      Iraq wished not only to acquire a missile system of several hundred kilometers 
      range, but that it was also intent on acquiring the capacity and technology 
      to build composite solid propellant rockets in-country, starting with the 
      BADR-2000 first stage motor without flexible-joint nozzle. (BADR-2000 Junior).</font></p>
