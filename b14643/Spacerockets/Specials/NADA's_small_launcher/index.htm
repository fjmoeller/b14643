          --North Korea Space Development Agency (NADA) conducted a test for reconnaissance 
          satellite development at the Seohae Satellite Launching Station.<br>

          The launcher used for the test is most likely a modified Hwasong-7 (HS-7) 
          with a diameter of 1.25m from the Nodong series. It has an attached second 
          stage with a short payload unit for the camera equipment.<br>
          The altitude reached of 500km is ideal for a future reconnaissance satellite. 
          In the current case, the payload will probably not have reached the required 
          final speed for a stable orbit, despite the second stage (which of course 
          also has its own weight). This was not planned for the test either and 
          the &quot;camera&quot; has already disappeared from orbit.<br>
          The published photos of the camera show South Korean territoriy from a 
          vertical perspective, which we can only be explained with an &quot;overflight&quot;.<br>
          If it had been a ballistic trajectory tangered or passedg South Korea, 
          it would have huge protests.<br>
          Therefore I assume a short-term orbit. This means the second stage terminal 
          velocity would have been too slow to maintain an orbit. It may not even 
          have completed a full orbit. Nobody can complain, after all it was a &quot;satellite&quot; 
          that passed South Korea. The first stage would therefore already have 
          fallen back over North Korean territory (according to North Korean indications, 
          slowed down by a parachute). The second stage did the rest and later burned 
          up like the camera equipment.</font></p>
