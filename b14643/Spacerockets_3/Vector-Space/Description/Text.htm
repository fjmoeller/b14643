    Vector Space is fielding a family of small launch vehicles consisting of the 
    Vector-R (Rapide) and the Vector-H (Heavy). The Vector-R is design for rapid 
    and frequent launch of payloads weighing up to 50 kg and will be available for 
    commercial flights in 2018 and is designed to have launch cadence up to 100 
    flights per year. The Vector-H is a larger vehicle based on the Vector-R design 
    but capable of deploying 100kg class satellites into LEO and launching small 
    deep space missions. The Vector-H will be available in mid 2019 for commercial 
    flights at launch cadences up to 25 flights per year. Both launch vehicles will 
    operate from either Kodiak Alaska (PSCA) or Cape Canaveral (CCAFS).<br>
    <br>
    The Vector launch vehicle family derives historically from the Garvey Spacecraft 
    NLV-20 launch vehicle that has been under development for a number of years. 
    These vehicles use an all carbon fiber fuselage along with pressurized propulsion 
    feed systems operated by patented pressurization systems using safe low pressure 
    systems. The Vector-R is a larger version of the NLV-20 using three first stage 
    engines and a larger second stage for more orbital insertion capability. The 
    Vector-H is a stretched version of the Vector-R and uses a five engine first 
    stage with longer tanks and a full diameter second stage. Both vehicles share 
    common avionics and engines. Vector Space offer optional electric third stages 
    and both standard and enlarged payload fairings for both vehicles.<br>
    <br>
    The Vector-R launches 50 kg to Low Earth orbit with a small, simple two-stage 
    rocket. Vector Space launch into polar and Sun Synchronous orbits from the Pacific 
    Spaceport Complex in Alaska (PSCA) and low inclination orbits from Cape Canaveral 
    Air Force Station (CCAFS) in Florida. An optional Electric Upper Stage (EUS) 
    will place up to 45 kg into 800 km orbits.<br>
    <br>
    Until now, Micro Satellites have relied on secondary launches aboard larger 
    launch vehicles leaving the choice of destination and launch schedule to others. 
    Vector is the world’s smallest launch vehicle on the market dedicated to servicing 
    micro satellites and will provide frequent and reliable space access allowing 
    you to go where you want when you want.<br>
    The Vector-H launches 110 kg to Low Earth orbit with a small, simple two-stage 
    rocket. Vector Space launch into polar and Sun Synchronous orbits from the Pacific 
    Spaceport Complex in Alaska (PSCA) and low inclination orbits from Cape Canaveral 
    Air Force Station (CCAFS) in Florida. An optional Electric Upper Stage (EUS) 
    will place up to 100 kg into 800 km orbits.&nbsp; (Source: Vector Space).<br>
