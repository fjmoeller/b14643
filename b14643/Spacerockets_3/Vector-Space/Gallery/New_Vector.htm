      <td width="100%" height="1"><font size="2">The Vector small launch vehicle 
      developer that went bankrupt in 2019, is getting a second chance under <b>
      <font color="#FF0000">new ownership</font></b>, with changes to both its technology 
      and initial markets.<br>
      The new owner of Vector’s launch assets is a consortium led by <i>John Moran</i>, 
      president and chief executive of Moran Logistics, a shipping company based 
      in Pennsylvania. They are restarting Vector with <i>Robert Spalding</i>, a 
      retired Air Force brigadier general who previously served on the staff of 
      the National Security Council, as chief executive.<br>
      Vector had been developing engines that used propylene and liquid oxygen propellants. 
      The new Vector plans to instead use <b><font color="#FF0000">new &quot;Tanner&quot;engines</font></b> 
      powered by a more conventional combination of liquid oxygen and refined kerosene, 
      or RP-1, propellants. <br>
      Testing of the engines will begin shortly, followed by integrating the engines 
      into the existing design of the <b><font color="#FF0000">Vector-R</font></b> 
      rocket. The company expects to make only limited other changes to the rocket, 
      such as a new helium pressurization system for the engines, but the company 
      may reconsider the use of a vehicle structure made entirely of carbon composites. 
      The improved performance of the new engines could allow Vector to replace 
      some composite structures with aluminum, reducing cost and complexity.<br>
      A first suborbital flight of the revised Vector-R could take place in 12 to 
      15 months. One vehicle was nearly completed at the time Vector went bankrupt, 
      with several more in various stages of assembly. There are also components 
      and materials in stock for dozens of more rockets, which the original Vector 
      purchased as part of its mass production plans.<br>
      Another change for Vector is that the company will initially focus on suborbital 
      rather than orbital launches.<br>
