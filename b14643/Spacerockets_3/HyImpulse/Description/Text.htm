<b>HyImpulse Technolgies GmbH</b></font> is developing a game changing, three-stage 
smallsat launch vehicle with hybrid rocket engines in order to transport satellites 
with a payload of up to 500 kg into a dedicated Earth orbit.</p>
<p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">&quot;The hybrid rocket motors are especially suited for 
a rapid entry to market with very low cost of propellants (paraffin and liquid oxygen). 
The hybrid propulsion allows safe and flexible operation of the launch service. 
The SL1 will be based on the same hybrid rocket motor that is being used for sounding 
rockets. Twelve motors of this type will be used for a single SL1, allowing serial 
production of the hardware. The propulsion system will be completed by a newly developed 
turbopump system for liquid oxygen, to bring the hybrid rocket engines to a performance 
level and commercial application, which has been never seen before.&quot;<br>

      <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">Both propellants are the most affordable (in 
      comparison to H2O2 and HTPB) and the safest propellants (LOX/Paraffin are 
      green and non-toxic whereas H2O2 and HTPB are both hazardous and more difficult 
      to use).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">LOX is by far the oxidizer with the highest 
      performance for hybrid rocket engines. Our propellants offer more than 40 
      sec higher specific impulse compared to hydrogen peroxide or nitrous oxide, 
      which is an increase of about 14%.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">The combustion chamber technology is simple: 
      The advanced paraffin-based fuels have a high regression rate and are mechanically 
      stable at the same time, due to the carefully refined and validated formula 
      that HyImpulse uses. HyImpulse’s paraffin formulation is unique in Europe. 
      The high regression rate makes it possible, that the fuel has a simple cylindrical 
      shape, which outperforms the classical fuels like HTPB in a significant way, 
      both in thrust to weight ratio and fuel residuals. The superior performance 
      (specific Impulse - Isp) of the hybrid engine has been demonstrated already 
      in the <font color="#FF0000">HEROS 3</font> rocket launches with more than 
      97% combustion efficiency.</p>

      structure technology, developing composite tanks for the liquid oxidizer, 
      composite structures and composite combustion chambers.</p>
