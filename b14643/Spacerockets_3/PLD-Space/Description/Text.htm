<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2"><u><b>History:</b></u> 
PLD Space (founders Raul Torres and Raul Verdu) is developing conventional small 
rocket launchers for suborbital and orbital markets, Arion-1 and Arion-2. Founded 
in 2011, the company targets to provide commercial and scientific access to space 
in the fields of space technologies, picosatellites and nanosatellites, microgravity 
scientific investigation and defense technologies.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2">&nbsp; PLD wants to develop 
small launchers called Arion. In a first phase will develop the suborbital rocket 
Arion-1. Arion-1 will take off from the base of INTA&#39;s El Arenosillo and reach a 
maximum height of 300 km before falling into the Atlantic Ocean.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2">The Arion-1 has a launch 
mass of 2.4 tons, a length of 12.4 meters, a diameter of 0.64 m and is capable of 
launching up to 250 kg payload. The key to everything is the launcher propulsion 
system. PLD Space has chosen kerosene and liquid oxygen as the combination of safer 
and more efficient propellants. Arion-1 uses for the first stage an open-cycle engine 
with 70 kN thrust, called <b>PLDK70-A</b>, while the second stage uses a pressure-feed 
motor with 25 kN thrust (<b>PLDK20-B</b>).<br>
<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Note</span>: The new version of Arion-1 
is a one-stage vehicle. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2">&nbsp; If the Arion-1 
succeeds, PLD Space wants to go further and create the</font><font size="2" color="#000080">
</font><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><b>Arion-2</b></font><font size="2">, a small 
space launcher. The Arion-2 is a three-stage rocket capable of placing 100 kg payload 
into a low orbit 250 miles high. Its take-off mass would be 7.4 tons and its dimensions 
would be 20.87 x 1.20 meters. The first stage engine with 200 kN of thrust is formed 
by four chambers of the engine similar to the first stage of combustion Arion-1.<br>
The second stage uses the Arion-1 engine PLDK20-B, but the duration of 40 seconds 
is increased to 120 seconds. Also will include a third stage with hypergolic fuel 
and equipped with a 6 kN engine. It would accelerate the speed.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><b><font color="#FF0000">Miura-5</font></b><font color="#000080"> 
(previously called Arion 2) is a planned two-stage orbital recoverable launch vehicle 
of PLD Space. Miura-5 will be 25 m long and 1.8 m in diameter, capable of inserting 
300 kg of payload into a 500 km sun-synchronous orbit (SSO), featuring an optional 
kick stage that can circularize the orbits of satellites. All stages are planned 
to be liquid-propelled and its technology is inherited from a Miura-1 suborbital 
rocket. The first stage is planned to be reusable through the combined use of its 
engines and parachutes for retrieval. </font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080">The Miura-5 will 
use a TEPREL-C turbopump engine, unlike previous versions which use a pressurized 
tank cycle. Its reuse capabilities are planned to allow it to be launched 3 times.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080">On 11 April 2019, 
PLD Space performed a successful crash and recovery test of the first stage of a 
Miura-5 demonstrator (1.5 m diameter instead of 1.8 m) in El Arenosillo. The stage 
was dropped from a height of 5 km, slowed down with three parachutes and touched 
the water, where it was recovered. </font></p>

PLD Space is working since 2014 with a proprietary propulsion system that will be 
used as first stage of the suborbital reusable rocket Arion-1 (now Miura-1). So 
far, the company has performed more than 30 tests of their first liquid rocket engine 
configuration, called calorimetric version, and now the Spanish Government with 
TEPREL will help PLD Space to continue its development with the regenerative version 
and the flight qualification unit.<br>
In cooperation with TEPREL, the company is also working in parallel with a new engine 
version that uses the same TCA (Thrust Chamber Assembly) but has some modifications

    <font size="2" color="#800080"><u><b>PLDK engine</b></u><br>
    The PLDK engine was first tested in 2015. It is a calorimetric engine model, 
    intended to demonstrate combustion stability as well as to acquire relevant 
    information such as ignition and shut-down sequences, pressures and temperatures 
    along the engine, thrust and propellant mass flow rates at different thrust 
    profiles. Additionally, the engine served to test all associated hardware and 
    software at PLD Space Propulsion Test Facilities. The engine is capable to produce 
    a thrust of <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">28 kN</span> at sea level.
    <br>
    <u><b>TEPREL-A engine</b></u><br>
    With the TEPREL-A engine, first tested in 2017, the company included several 
    design upgrades, such as a new combustion chamber design, an improved injector 
    geometry and a regenerative cooling system. The later enables the engine to 
    fire for nearly 2 minutes.<br>
&nbsp;At sea level, the engine produces a thrust of
    <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">32 kN</span>. The chamber pressure of 
    the TEPREL engine is 22 bar. The fuel mixture ratio is 2.35<br>
    <u><b>TEPREL-B engine</b></u><br>
    TEPREL-B is the first flight version of the TEPREL engine for the Miura-1. Several 
    design improvements have been implemented to reduce the overall weight of the 
    engine. It is equipped with a thrust-vector-control system and a convergent-divergent 
    nozzle, all regeneratively cooled. In May 2019 the first unit of this model 
    was destroyed during a test. After a long investigation PLD Space concluded 
    that the problem was due to excess pressure during engine start at ignition. 
    PLD Space addressed the issue through a combination of improvements to the launch 
    site infrastructure and procedural improvements. It is currently fully operational. 
    In February 2020, PLD Space successfully completed a 122-second test that allowed 
    it to achieve flight rating. <br>
    On August 28, 2020, PLD Space completed required tests for the thrust vector 
    control system on the TEPLEL-B rocket engine. <br>
