<p align="left"><b><font size="2" color="#FF0000">Firefly Space Systems</font></b><font size="2">, 
a ground-based, small satellite launch company, has officially announced its first 
launch vehicle,<font color="#000080"> “</font>Firefly Alpha.” This efficient, brand 
new vehicle is capable of carrying 400kg into low earth orbit and will be the world’s 
first dedicated light satellite launch vehicle in this mass class.<br>
Following its official launch and seed funding in January 2014, Firefly has aggressively 
moved forward in its mission to lower the prohibitively high costs of small satellite 
launches to Low Earth and Sun Synchronous Orbits with the goal of revolutionizing 
broadband data delivery and earth observation missions. <br>
&quot;Firefly Alpha represents a revolution in light satellite launch design. It’s the 
first vehicle in a scalable family of launchers specifically designed to address 
the needs of the light satellite (&lt; 1,000kg) community. Featuring an aerospike engine 
and the lowest launch cost in its class, this all-composite launch vehicle is set 
to completely transform the entire industry.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>CEDAR PARK, Texas</b>, Sept. 10, 2015 -- Firefly 
Space Systems announced that it has successfully tested its first rocket engine, 
Firefly Rocket Engine Research 1 (&quot;FRE-R1&quot;). <br>
Firefly is developing one combustor design that will be utilized to power both stages 
of their small-sat launcher&nbsp; &quot;Firefly Alpha.&quot; The Alpha upper stage will utilize 
an engine (FRE-1) with a single combustor, whereas the first stage engine (FRE-2) 
will use an array of twelve of the same combustors arranged in an annular aerospike 
configuration.<br>
FRE-R1 is a propulsion pathfinder for both stages of Alpha. It operates using LOX/RP-1 
propellants, but the basic combustor design can utilize either methane or RP-1 fuels. 
The upper stage variant of the engine (FRE-1) will produce 7,000 lbf thrust, and 
the first stage cluster used in FRE-2 will produce 125,000 lbf thrust. <br>
The first stage of Firefly Alpha will incorporate 12 &quot;aerospike&quot; engines arrayed 
in a ring pattern. Aerospike engines — which are wedge-shaped, without the familiar 
bell-shaped rocket nozzle — use aerodynamic principles to increase efficiency across 
the broad range of pressures experienced during flight.</font></p>

<font color="#FF0000" size="2">Firefly Aerospace</font></b><font color="#000080" size="2"> 
is a private aerospace firm based in Austin, Texas. After going bankrupt of Firefly 
Space Systems and being liquidated in March 2017, the company was re-created as 
Firefly Aerospace by Noosphere Ventures, who bought out the assets of former Firefly 
Space Systems. Firefly Aerospace is now working on the Alpha 2.0 launch vehicle 
which has a significantly larger payload capability than the previous Alpha developed 
by Firefly Space Systems. It aims to place a 1,000 kg payload into a 200 kilometer 
low earth orbit. <br>
&nbsp;The plans for engine development were significantly altered by the new management, 
and the revised Alpha vehicle features a pump-fed engine and removes the aerospike 
configuration. The reorganization has delayed development by approximately a year, 
with the first launch expected in the third quarter of 2019.<br>
<br>
It utilizes Reaver-1 and Lightning-1 engines and a lightweight carbon composite 
structure to reduce launch weight, resulting in improved payload fraction.<br>
Development of engines and structures has resumed and Firefly Aerospace has performed 
multiple hot-fire tests of its Lightning-1 second stage engine on its existing horizontal 
test stand. A vertical stage test stand is nearing completion and stage testing 
is expected to begin in the second half of 2018.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>2018, February</b> -- Firefly Aerospace has obviously 
abandoned the plan to develop an Aerospike engine for the first stage of its Alpha 
rocket. For the new Alpha, a conventional engine &quot;Reaver-1&quot; is in development.<br>
Both Firefly engines use copper regen-cooled RP-1/LOX thrust chambers, a simple 
tap-off cycle which drives single shaft turbopumps, nozzle-mounted turbine exhaust 
manifolds, and hydraulic actuators. Innovations in Firefly engines include our simple 
“Crossfire” injector, tap-off geometry, dual-mounted electrically actuated, trim-able 
propellant main valves, and ultra-compact horizontal turbopump mounting. The upper 
stage engine, “Lightning,” includes a turbine-exhaust cooled refractory metal high 
area ratio nozzle extension. The first stage “Reaver” engines feature simple single 
axis gimballing.</font><font color="#800080" size="2"><br>
