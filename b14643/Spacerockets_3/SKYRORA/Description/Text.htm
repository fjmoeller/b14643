    launch vehicle in flight configuration. This means all actions of a launch have 
    been performed, but did not release the vehicle. The rocket engine successfully 
    burned, with all vehicle systems showing nominal operation<br>
    Skylark-L is a bi-liquid propellant launch vehicle and is Skyrora’s first sub-orbital 
    flight vehicle, ready to reach a height of approximately 100km and carry a payload 
    of up to 60kg. Skylark-L uses a propellant combination of Hydrogen Peroxide 
    and Kerosene which are pressure fed into a Skyrora 30kN engine.<br>
    Building up to the static fire test, the rocket engine itself has gone through 
    three hot fire tests before integration into the vehicle. When commercial, the 
    company plans to use their own Ecosene, an equivalent Kerosene fuel made from 
    un-recyclable plastic waste.<br>

    <td width="79%"><b><font color="#FF0000">Skyrora Limited </font></b>is a UK 
    company headquartered in Edinburgh, producing launch vehicle technology inspired 
    by Black Arrow.<p>&quot;We aim to reduce the cost of space launches through the combination 
    of proven technology and advanced engineering methods. We have already started 
    developing a sounding rocket to test our technology. As part of that process, 
    we are building a robust supply chain focused on UK companies, creating new 
    employment opportunities throughout our industrial sector.<br>
    We aree planning to test our engines in Westcott, which played an important 
    part in the Black Arrow project. Like us, Black Arrow used hydrogen peroxide 
    as its oxidiser and we&#39;re proud to be following in its footsteps 50 years on.<br>
    When it comes to selecting a launch site, we believe there is nowhere better 
    than Scotland.<br>
    In the meantime, we will keep building and testing our rockets, helped along 
    by <font color="#FF0000">Skyrora&#39;s Ukrainian R&amp;D team</font> located in Dnipro 
    boasting decades of experience and detailed knowledge. With their support, we 
    will achieve our aims to produce a cost effective launch vehicle that combines 
    the best of British industry with practical experience. Our ability to leverage 
    talent and experience from our Ukrainian specialists is the key to our continued 
    growth and success.&quot;</p>
