of Electron`s first stage is not planed from the mission 10, but the stage has new 
guidance and navigation hardware, plus a reaction control system to orient the stage 
during re-entry. The stage plummets back to Earth at approx. mach 8.5. That’s more 
than 2.3 km meters per second. The focus is on monitoring the stage as it comes 
back to Earth so can better understand the reentry environments it needs to survive. 
The data will help to inform first efforts to recover a stage next year.</font><b><font size="2" color="#000080"><br>

-- RocketLab successfully carried out the first test flight of its Electron rocket. 
&quot;It was a great flight,” said Peter Beck, Rocket Lab’s CEO. “We had a great first 
stage burn, stage separation, second stage ignition and fairing separation. We didn’t 
quite reach orbit and we’ll be investigating why.<br>
The first stage engines were scheduled to switch off at&nbsp; 2 minutes, 30 seconds, 
followed by first stage separation around four seconds later. A single modified 
Rutherford engine on the Electron’s second stage was programmed to ignite for nearly 
five minutes to drive the launcher into an orbit between 300 and 500 kilometers 
above Earth.</font><br>

office in Auckland, New Zealand. Rocket Lab founded in 2007 by New Zealander, Peter 
Beck. The company is focused on delivering innovative, high quality technologies 
to the space industry.<br>
Rocket Lab was the first private company to reach space in the southern hemisphere 
in 2009 with its Atea 1 suborbital sounding rocket. Following this success the company 
won contracts with aerospace giants Lockheed Martin, DARPA and Aeroject Rocketdyne.</font></p>
<p align="left"><u><b><font size="2">July, 2014</font></b></u><font size="2"><br>
Rocket Lab announced its plan to revolutionize the global space industry with the 
creation of a small <u>two-stage space launcher</u> &quot;<b>Electron</b>&quot;, a lightweight, 
cost-effective rocket to launch small satellites into orbit.<br>
Rocket Lab is building the world’s first carbon-composite launch vehicle at its 
Auckland, New Zealand facility.<br>
The Electron launcher is 18m in length, 1m diameter and will weigh more than 10 
tons. This will be the first vehicle of its class capable of delivering payloads 
up to 100kg into low Earth orbits (LEO).<br>
Rocket Lab’s experience in highly innovative propulsion systems has lead to the 
engine <b>Rutherford</b>, a regeneratively cooled liquid rocket engine, and the 
heart of the Electron launch vehicle. With the first test fires in December 2013 
began the characterization phase of the engine program.</font></p>

    A single Rutherford engine pumps rocket-grade kerosene and liquid oxygen from 
    the low pressure tanks into the combustion chamber producing 13.3 kilonewtons 
    of thrust at lift-off. The regeneratively cooled engine passes the kerosene 
    through channels in the chamber walls, allowing Rutherford to run at temperatures 
    far beyond its melting point and at a significantly higher efficiency.<br>
    Electron uses two variants of the Rutherford engine, a sea level and a vacuum 
    engine. The vacuum variant differs only in nozzle shape, which is tailored to 
    suit the vacuum conditions outside Earth’s atmosphere. The duplicate engine 
    design for both stages makes Electron highly optimized for mass production.</font><font size="2" color="#000080"><br>
