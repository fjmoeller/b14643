<font color="#FF0000">Astra Space, Inc.</font></b> (Astra Space), formerly Ventions, 
LLC, is a San Francisco-based aerospace research and design firm with a ten-year 
history of developing aerospace technology in partnership with NASA. Ventions, LLC 
was founded in 2005 and reincorporated as Astra Space, Inc. in September 2016.<br>
Astra Space is now in phase of development and flight-testing of a high-performance 
electric pump fed launch vehicle.<br>
The project is focused on the development of a custom pump and electric motor capable 
of pressurizing propellants for an 8,000-10,000 lbf liquid bipropellant engine. 
Availability of such high-power pumps will not only allow for low pressure storage 
of propellants in light tanks for small-scale launch vehicle stages, but also provide 
electronic speed control with fast response times that may enable differential throttle 
control. The scope of the project includes design, fabrication, assembly and testing 
of a high-power electric pump capable of pressuring propellants to approximately 
600 psi for an 8.000-10,000 lbf thrust engine.<font color="#FF0000"><br>
</font>&nbsp;It is unlikely, however, that the current launcher match the advertised 
project, but rather represents is a <font color="#FF0000">XS-1 tactical missile</font> 
with five RP-1/LOX engines (each of 4,000 lbf thrust) with total thrust of 89 kN. 
The future two-stage vehicle is to be able to transport 100 kg into a LEO.<br>
The Astra LV was shown first for public in February 2018 at the
<font color="#FF0000">Alameda Naval Air Station.</font></p>

A launch license the FAA issued to Astra Space Inc. on Oct. 15, also available on 
the FAA website, authorized the company to perform a suborbital flight of its “Rocket 
2” vehicle from Launch Pad 2 at Pacific Spaceport Complex-Alaska, the commercial 
launch site on Kodiak Island, Alaska, operated by Alaska Aerospace Corp.<br>
</font><font size="1"><br>
</font><font size="2">As the name suggests, the launch was the second for Astra 
Space. The company performed an initial suborbital launch, also from Kodiak, July 
21. The launch took place in foggy conditions and the outcome was also shrouded 
in secrecy: the FAA said that launch suffered an unspecified “mishap” but Alaska 
Aerospace Corp. said the customer for that launch, which it declined to disclose 
citing a nondisclosure agreement, was “very pleased with the outcome of the launch.”<br>
The company conducted the first test launch at the spaceport in July&nbsp; that 
was terminated 21 seconds into the rocket&#39;s flight. The rocket was terminated before 
it reached its suborbital destination, but the launch was still considered successful.</font></p>
