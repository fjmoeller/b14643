    <font size="2">The Black Arrow 2 will be a two-stage initially all expendable 
    rocket using Liquid Oxygen (LOX) and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) which is mainly 
    methane as propellants. Standing nearly 25m tall, it is a two stage orbital 
    space launch vehicle designed to reliably deploy small satellites in support 
    of missions for the UK Space Agency (UKSA), European Space Agency (ESA) and 
    commercial satellite companies from all around the world.<br>
    The 1.8 m diameter first stage will use a single 500 kN thrust gas-generator 
    cycle pump fed engine while the upper stage will be powered by a 45 kN pressure 
    fed upper-stage engine.<br>
    <br>
    The initial version of the Horizon Space Techologies’ Black Arrow 2 is being 
    designed to lift at least 500 kg to 200×200 km equatorial orbit, or 350 kg to 
    600×600 km sun-synchronous orbit.</font><p><b><font color="#FF0000">New:</font></b></p>

    The Black Arrow 2 two-stage launch vehicle will be designed and manufactured 
    in Oxfordshire.<br>
    The vehicle will be constructed with leading edge composites, using patented 
    techniques, developed and refined with expertise from successful Formula 1 teams.<br>
    Propellant and other pressure tanks within the vehicle will be designed and 
    constructed by Astrotanks Company using advanced manufacturing techniques.. 
    Fully composite replacements will appear a short time.<br>
    The rocket will be powered by proven engine and propulsion technologies, adapted 
    for use in the Black Arrow 2 launch vehicle, comprising innovative 3D printed 
    parts, and using cryogenic Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) and Liquid Oxygen propellants..
    <b>Five engines will provide ~450 kN thrust</b> to the first stage, with added 
    reliability and recovery function, with a single-engine propelling the upper 
    stage.<br>
    <br>
    Black Arrow Space Technologies will launch payloads of up to 500 kg into Polar 
    Low Earth Orbit, or up to 300 kg into Sun Synchronous Orbit, from a unique seaborne 
    launch vessel.<br>
    The service will be marketed under &quot;<b>Horizon Sea Launch</b>&quot;.</font></p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> A <font color="#FF0000">&quot;Goldfinch-3&quot;</font> is named as the 
    engine. Obviously, the concept for this engine has recently been changed so 
    that 5 smaller are used instead of one large.</p>
