Indonesia’s space agency LAPAN has announced its aim to launch an indigenous orbital 
rocket by 2040, with the ability to insert a 1-tonne satellite into Low Earth Orbit 
(LEO). LAPAN’s orbital launch vehicle development programme will take a gradual, 
incremental approach to growing the rocket size, engines, and propulsion systems, 
and will be conducted in four phases:<br>
<br>
</font><b><font size="2">The first phase, which it is currently undergoing now, 
aims to develop a launch vehicle capable of delivering a 50kg payload into an altitude 
of 300km. The launch vehicle for this phase will be a 3-stage, solid fuel rocket. 
Phase-1 is expected to be completed in 2019-2020.</font></b><font size="2"><br>
<br>
Following that, LAPAN will begin its second phase, which will aim to add strap-on 
boosters to the vehicle, in order to increase the rocket’s thrust and payload capability. 
This will enable the vehicle to take 100kg to an altitude of 300km.<br>
The programme’s third phase will develop a liquid propulsion engine, to be used 
in conjunction with its solid-fuel strap-on boosters. Phases 2 and 3 are expected 
to take 10 years, and be completed by 2029, with the provision to extend Phase 3 
if necessary. By the end of Phase 3, LAPAN should have a launch vehicle capable 
of taking 100kg to a 600km LEO.<br>
The final phase of LAPAN’s planned rocket development programme will begin in 2029, 
where the agency will work on the rocket’s exact specifications and orbital insertion 
capabilities. The targeted completion date of the vehicle is 2039, with its launch 
to take place at Indonesia’s new launch complex in 2040.<br>
<br>
At the moment, LAPAN has a series of sounding rockets which it tests on a regular 
basis, including the liquid-propellant sounding rocket</font></font><font size="2">

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2">The National Space and 
Aeronautics Institute (LAPAN) plans to launch its RX-420 rocket for the first time 
on July 2. RX-420 rocket fabrication took three months only, with specification 
as follows: 420 mm diameter, 1,000 kg launching load, 6,200 mm long, fuel solid, 
13 sec combustion time, 205 sec departure time, 4.5 mach maximum speed, 101 km predicted 
cruise distance range, 53 km predicted vertical distance and with load: diagnostic 
tool, GPS, altitude-meter, gyro, 3-axis accelerometer, processor and battery.<br>
The RX-420 rocket is the forerunner to Indonesia&#39;s next indigenous orbital satellite 
launching vehicle program. The announcement was made by Research and Technology 
Minister Kusmayanto Kadiman in Jakarta. During a meeting with Commission VII of 
the House of Representatives, Kadiman said the launch of the RX-420 rocket, with 
a range of 100 km, will be conducted by LAPAN, which had successfully launched a 
RX-320 rocket in 2008. He added that the RX-420 rocket possessed more power than 
the RX-320 and its range could be increased to 190 km if the rocket&#39;s weight was 
reduced. Apart from the scheduled launch in July, there are plans to carry out further 
test launches in 2010 and 2011. In 2014, LAPAN will have finished all its experimental 
rocket launches and will have already developed a rocket with a range of 300 km 
and speed of 7.8 km/sec allowing it to carry a small satellite into space, he said, 
adding that this would be a “monumental achievement.”</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2">LAPAN that already 45 
years on November 27, since 2007 had boosted rocket and satellite study and development, 
especially after got ability to produce solid rocket fuel.<br>
In 2007, RX-250 (250 mm) had been launched successfully with distance 53 km. After 
good result on static test, RX-320 rocket has successfully launched in Pameungpek, 
West Java on May 19, 2008 by transmitting navigation system data, aerodynamics performance, 
trajectory, environment condition and any obstruction during launching. The special 
improvement from this test was RX-320 rocket used Indonesian own solid propellant. 
RX-320 rocket has dimension 320 mm diameter x 4,736 mm long and weight 532 kg. The 
trust power is 52 ton and reached 42 km as per design.<br>
After successfully launched that experimental rocket with diameter 320 mm or coded 
RX-320, LAPAN again succeeded static test RX-420 on 23/12/2008 at LAPAN Aerospace 
Technology Center, Tarogong, Tangerang. In 2009, Chief of LAPAN Adi Sadewo Salatun 
said after successful static test of RX-420, rocket launching program will be continued 
in 2009.<br>
<br>
This RX-420 rocket is the main part of the first LAPAN satellite orbital launching 
vehicle (RPS) that scheduled in 2014, said by Yus Kadarusman Markis, chief of LAPAN 
Aerospace Technology Center. The RPS consists of three-stage rockets, which is in 
the first stage will be three RX-420 as booster, in second stage one RX-420 as sustainer 
and the last is RX-320. With that configuration and LAPAN solid fuel, the SLV-1 
has capability to launch nano satellite to the orbit.<br>
One RX-420 rocket is designed to have distance range about 120 km. With RPS configuration, 
it may reach a vertical height up to 400 km. This rocket can be loaded 5 kg load 
to be able to the orbit minimum 250 km high and at horizontal speed at 8 km/sec.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2">For the next development, 
LAPAN will develop rockets with bigger diameter, such as RX-750, and liquid fuel 
that has better performance than solid fuel. RX-420 is the sixth rocket developed 
by Lapan after 70, 100, 150, 250, and 320 mm.</font></p>

LAPAN rockets are classified &quot;RX&quot; (Roket Eksperimental) followed by the diameter 
in millimeters. LAPAN&#39;s current workhouse rocket propulsion system consists of four 
stages, namely the three-stage RX 420 and the RX-320 level. It is planned to use 
the RX-420 as a booster (rocket booster) RPS for the planned Roket Pengorbit Satelit

    G</font>arut, 2014, August 22</b> - Tests of the rockets <b>RX-450 and RX-320</b> 
    in Pameungpeuk, Garut, West Java, were successful. Both types are now qualified 
    by the seemingly insurmountable difficulties with the RX-550 for the satellite

    As a result of the static test the new RX-450 will burning 18 sec. In the static 
    test, even a burn time of 19.5 seconds was achieved. <br>
    The RX-450 (diameter of 450 mm) has a total length of 6110 mm, and provides 
    a thrust of 12,895 kg (126.45 kN). The housing for the rocket propellant has 
    a length of 4459 mm. After the first succesful test, the RX-450 is ready for 
    flight tests end of 2014. <br>
    <br>
    The flight test of the RX-320 which is already previously been developed has 
    met the expectations. With a launch angle of 70 ° was reached a flight altitude 
    of 20-30 miles. <br>
    The combination RX-450 and RX-320 is indeed suitable only for atmospheric soundings, 
    but should be a new perspective for the development of the launch vehicle <b>
