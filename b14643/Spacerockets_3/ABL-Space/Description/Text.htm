place on January 10, 2023 but ended with an anomaly shortly after launch. The engines 
shut down and the rocket fell back.</font></p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#FF0000">ABL Space Systems</font></b> was founded 
in 2017 and based in El Segundo, California. ABL’s <b><font color="#FF0000">launch 
vehicle RS-1</font></b> is a two-stage rocket.<br>
RS-1 utilizes a relightable second stage engine, which can deliver payloads to many 
unique orbits. As a reference, most missions will require two second stage burns. 
With this two-burn mission design, RS1 is capable of deploying 970kg to a 500km 
SSO. The RS-1 is designed to access the higher altitude orbits of MEO and GTO.
<br>
<font size="1"><br>
</font>The RS1 is a two-stage to orbit launch vehicle with stage separation occurring 
at approximately 160 seconds into flight. The second stage engine cut off (SECO) 
at approximately ~508 seconds. <br>
The RS-1 uses nine E2 SL engines on the first stage and one E2 VAC engine on the 
second. RS1 is six feet in diameter and 88-feet long when fully integrated. Both 
stages use liquid oxygen (LOX) as oxidizer and kerosene as propellant.<br>
The vehicle’s primary structure is entirely metallic, employing high-strength, reliable 
aluminum alloys. RS-1 utilizes a common dome tank architecture to minimize structural 
mass. Tank barrels are grid-stiffened with an isogrid design. The front end of the 
vehicle includes a custom-designed payload adapter fitting and a metallic bi-conic 
fairing with acoustic protection.<br>
<font size="1"><br>
</font>ABL developed the E2 engine. It is a gas generator cycle engine and produces 
13,000 lbf of thrust.<br>
All E2 engine components are designed in-house, including the turbopump, main propellant 
valves, thrust chamber assembly, and gas generator. ABL machines and prints most 
E2 engine parts in-house. The thrust chamber uniquely finds liquid oxygen cooling 
and a copper alloy 3D printed in just a single piece.<br>
<font size="1"><br>
</font>As a standard, RS-1 uses a metallic, milled 80-inch (2.032m) diameter bi-conic 
fairing to shield the payload from aerodynamic buffeting and heating during ascent.</p>
