<font color="#FF0000"><b>AUSROC- III</b></font><font color="#000080"><br>
This small educational launcher is proposed for development by the nonprofit A.S.R.I. 
(</font><font color="#FF0000">Australian Space Research Institute</font><font color="#000080">), 
based at Adelaide and cooperating with 10 universities in Australia.<br>
<br>
The first rocket is Ausroc III which will be designed to launch a 150 kg payload 
to an altitude of 500 km on a controlled sub-orbital trajectory. The pressure fed 
LOX/Kerosene vehicle design will include an ablative rocket motor, hydraulic motor 
gimbal system, carbon fibre fairings, carbon filament wound tanks, inertial navigation, 
telemetry and a cold gas thruster roll control system. The payload will experience 
6 minutes of micro-gravity time before descending to earth under a guided controllable 
ram-air parachute. Ausroc III will be 9.2 metres long, 750 mm diameter, 1.5 tonne 
and will develop 35 kN thrust for 80 seconds.<b><br>
</b>Ausroc IV is presently the final stage of the Ausroc Programs. It is a proposed 
micro-satellite orbital launch vehicle to be constructed by clustering four Ausroc 
III vehicles (as the first stage) around a fifth vehicle which forms the second 
stage. The third stage is to be a solid fuel rocket motor. Ausroc IV will place 
a 30 kg satellite into a 300 km polar orbit.<br>
A significant amount of design and other work for Ausroc IV has been undertaken 
since 1990 in parallel with Ausroc III.<br>
In 1996 ASRI acquired a number of wedgetail third stage satellite launch vehicle 
motors from overseas. These motors are ideally suited as the third stage of Ausroc 
IV or as the second stage of a higher performance version of Ausroc III. Development 
of a composite solid fuel propellant composition for the Wedgetail&nbsp; motors&nbsp; 
has been completed by Adelaide University.<br>
Preliminary discussions with the UK based ASPIRESPACE organisation, which has similar 
objectives and charter to ASRI, have resulted in positive steps being made towards 
the collaborative development of Ausroc IV. Under the collaborative arrangement. 
ASPIRESPACE will provide the complete second stage module and assistance with the 
third stage hardware.<br>

<font size="2" color="#000080">The Australian Space Research Institute has been 
conducting an educational Launch Vehicle development program (AUSROC) since the 
late 1980’s. That program is currently comprised of: AUSROC 1 – Launched 1989, AUSROC 
2-1 – Launch Failure 1992, AUSROC 2-2 – Launched 1995, AUSROC 2.5 – Launch planned 
2009, AUSROC-III and AUSROC-IV were probably canceled. The ASRI program has strong 
local University support from all states in Australia. Each project has behind it 
a team of students and space industry professionals providing practical skills training 
and capability development.<br>
AUSROC 2.5 is well advanced with construction of cryogenic tanks and rocket motor 
completed and undergoing testing. This was conceived as an interim stage to develop 
local expertise to a level that can support the more capable AUSROC 3. AUSROC 3 
is intended to be the building block for a family of launch vehicles sharing a common 
architecture. The AUSROC-IV was designed to lift a 50kg satellite into Polar Low 
Earth Orbit from Woomera, South Australia. It uses four Ausroc-III modules in the 
1st stage, an Ausroc-III module in the 2nd stage, and a solid fuelled 3rd stage 
to achieve this.</font></p>

    <font color="#FF0000">AUSROC-Nano</font></b>, is a three stage to orbit liquid 
    fuelled rocket which has been predominantly designed by RMIT University students 
    in collaboration with the Australian Space Research Institute (ASRI). The design 
    and development has been ongoing since 2008 with the project to be ready for 
    launch of a 10 kg Nano satellite by 2018 (or later?).<br>
    Recent top level analyses indicate that a 10kg nano satellite could be launched 
    on a 3 stage vehicle using an AUSROC-III module as the first stage, a 2nd stage 
    based on the AUSROC-III kerosene tank with an integral bulkhead and a small 
    solid rocket motor as the 3rd stage. <br>
    Polar Low Earth Orbit (LEO) velocity is around 8,000m/s and launch losses from 
    drag and gravity approximate 1500m/s giving a total change in velocity requirement 
    of approximately 9,500m/s.</font></p>
