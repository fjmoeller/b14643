    transport vehicle will take humans and payloads on a half-hour suborbital flight 
    to 100 km and then return safely to a landing at the takeoff runway.<br>
    Lynx has an all-composite airframe that makes it lightweight and strong. With 
    an added thermal protection system (TPS) on the nose and leading edges it is 
    able to handle the heat of re-entry from the edge of space. The wing area is 
    sized for landing at moderate touchdown speeds near 90 knots. Lynx is about 
    9 meters in length with a double-delta wing that spans about 7.5 meters.</font></td>

    The Lynx Mark I is the initial flight test vehicle now under development at 
    XCOR’s Mojave, CA facilities. This prototype vehicle will be used to characterize 
    and flight test the various sub-systems of the craft including life support, 
    propulsion, tanks, structure, aeroshell, aerodynamics, re-entry heating and 
    other design elements. It will undergo a flight test program beginning in 2013. 
    The flight test program consists of a traditional envelope expansion regime 
    in which the vehicle is gradually tested to its full flight profile. The Mark 
    I will be placed into commercial service after being licensed as a launch vehicle 
    under Federal Aviation Administration rules. The Lynx Mark I will also be used 
    to train pilots and crew for the Lynx Mark II. The Lynx Mark I is designed to 
    achieve an altitude of approximately 61 km.<br>
    <br>
    <b>The Lynx Mark II</b><br>
    The Lynx Mark II will begin construction and assembly during the Lynx Mark I 
    development program. The Mark II is the production version of the Lynx, servicing 
    both the suborbital tourism market and all markets that make use of the Lynx’s 
    internal payload volumes, such as microgravity and biotechnology experiments. 
    The Lynx Mark II uses the same propulsion and avionics systems as the Lynx Mark 
    I, but has a lower dry weight and hence higher performance than the Mark I. 
    The Mark II incorporates a lightweight composite LOX tank integral with the 
    aeroshell and several other key innovations that are proprietary to XCOR. Designed 
    to fly to approximately 100 km, assuming certain payload weight conditions are 
    met, the Mark II will take payloads and spaceflight participants to the edge 
    of space and back.</font></p>

    The Lynx Mark III is a highly modified derivative of the Lynx Mark II that features 
    the ability to carry an external dorsal pod with either a payload experiment 
    or upper stage capable of launching a small satellite into low earth orbit. 
    Total payload capacity for the external dorsal pod is 650kg. The Lynx Mark III 
    is a different vehicle from the Mark II, featuring upgraded landing gear, aerodynamics, 
    core structural enhancements, and features a more powerful propulsion package 
    and other modifications needed to carry the extra weight aloft.</font></td>

    Propulsion</b><br>
    Lynx propulsion is four <b>XR-5K18</b> rocket engines, each producing 12.9 kN 
    (2900 lbf) vacuum thrust with kerosene and liquid oxygen propellants. Engine 
    detail design began in autumn of 2008. The first hot fire test was conducted 
    on 15 December 2008 (precursor engine XR-5M15). The XR-5K18 engine uses the 
    DARPA funded piston pump technology.</font></td>

<p><font size="2"><b>Mojave, 2013, March 26</b> -- XCOR Aerospace announced a first 
in aviation and space history, the firing of a full piston pump-powered rocket engine 
XR-5K18.<br>
The initial portion of XCOR’s pump test program culminated in a 67-second engine 
run with the propulsion system mated to the flight weight Lynx fuselage. After the 
installation of the flight sized liquid oxygen tank, the next test sequence will 
extend the engine run duration to the full powered flight duration of the Lynx Mark 
I suborbital vehicle.<br>
“Through use of our proprietary rocket propellant piston pumps we deliver both kerosene 
and liquid oxygen to our rocket engines and eliminate the need for heavy, high-pressure 
fuel and oxidizer tanks. It also enables our propulsion system to fly multiple times 
per day and last for tens of thousands of flights,” said XCOR Chief Executive Officer 
Jeff Greason. “<br>
