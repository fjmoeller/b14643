<p align="left"><font color="#000080"><b>Augsburg, Germany – 13th July 2022</b> 
– Launch&nbsp; service provider Rocket Factory Augsburg AG (RFA) successfully tested 
its &quot;Helix&quot; engine in flight configuration for a total of 74 seconds. The test campaign 
consisted of long-duration hot firings of 30 and 40 seconds each. This was preceded 
by a short test of four seconds. All three tests were conducted with the same engine, 
reached the desired duration, and were subsequently shut down safely.</font><br>
<i>&nbsp;“Helix operated perfectly for a total duration of 74 seconds– including 
three ignition and shut-down sequences without the need to replace any components 
on the engine. This first qualification campaign also included up-throttling the 
engine to 130% of the nominal design point for a brief period.&quot;</i></p>
<p><font color="#000080"><strong>About the Helix engine</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000080">Helix is a staged combustion engine, one of the most advanced 
engine types in the world. Unlike engines with an open combustion cycle, in RFA´s 
Helix engine the exhaust gases from an oxygen-rich preburner are fed into the main 
combustion chamber after driving the turbopump. The fuel is thus burned more completely.<br>
The Helix engine is operated with RP-1 as propellant and liquid oxygen as oxidizer, 
has a thrust of 100kN and an Isp of 325s (SL) / 350s (Vac). Nine Helix engines are 
used in the first stage, and one vacuum-optimized Helix engine in the second stage.</font></p>
