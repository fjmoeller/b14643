    (Taiwan Innovative Space) is the first private company in Taiwan. TiSPACE is 
    established to provide innovative and cost-effective launch services to the 
    global space community with increasing commercial needs of placing Nano- and 
    Micro-satellites into the low Earth orbits (LEO).<br>
    The headquarter of TiSpace is located in Chunan, Miaoli that is in close vicinity 
    with Taiwan high-tech science parks and industrial districts. TiSpace was established 
    in 2016 by a group of rocket scientists, aerospace engineers and entrepreneurs 
    who saw the emerging great opportunities in space privatization and technical 
    and economic future. Among them, Dr. Yen-Sen Chen, is a key technical person 
    who is a well-known researcher in the international space launch community. 
    He has an extensive experience in the technical developments of hybrid rocket 
    propulsion and launch vehicle systems. Dr. Chen initiated the hybrid rocket 
    system developments of Taiwan in 2009.<br>
    <font size="2"><br>
    </font>Since no approval was given for launch of the Hapith launchers in Taiwan, 
    TiSpace and all of its equipment moved to Whaler&#39;s Way (Australia). The first 
    launch is announced for September 2021.<br>
