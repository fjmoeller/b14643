<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font color="#FF0000">Generation 
Orbit Launch Services, Inc.</font> (GO) has completed an initial integrated engine 
firing of a full-scale, functional prototype of the GOLauncher1 (GO1) hypersonic 
flight test booster. Under contract to the Air Force Research Laboratory, Aerospace 
Systems Directorate, High Speed Systems Division (AFRL/RQH), GO is developing GO1 
to be an affordable and flexible hypersonic testbed to flight test a wide range 
of hypersonic vehicle technologies. The test was the first of its kind to be conducted 
at Cecil Spaceport in Jacksonville, FL. This is also GO’s first test campaign to 
include <font color="#FF0000"><b>Ursa Major Technologies’</b> “Hadley” liquid rocket engine</font>. 
The 5,000 lbf-class oxygen-rich staged combustion engine performed as expected through 
the tests.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
GO1 is a single-stage liquid rocket, launched from a Gulfstream III carrier aircraft, 
primarily designed for hypersonic flight testing. The rocket vehicle propulsion 
system utilizes liquid oxygen and kerosene propellants. The system is designed to 
provide affordable and regular access to high dynamic pressure flight conditions 
between Mach 5 and Mach 8 to a wide range of payloads for fundamental research, 
technology development, and risk reduction. The first flight of GO1 is planned for 
late 2019.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Building up a series of cold flows and engine development tests, this test demonstrated 
integration of the engine with flight like propellant tanks, valves, pressurization 
system, and flight controls. Further, the test demonstrated the throttling capabilities 
of the system necessary to meet the thrust levels for Mach 6 cruise at 80,000 to 
90,000 ft. This feature is a key enabler of GO1’s next-generation hypersonic flight 
testing capabilities for fundamental research and technology maturation.</p>
