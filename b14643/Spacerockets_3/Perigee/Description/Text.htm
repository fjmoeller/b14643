      Blue Whale-1 is a two-stage orbital launch vehicle capable of placing a 150 
      kg payload into a 500 km Sun-Synchronous Orbit with the fully reusable first 
      stage. Blue Whale is mainly constructed from high-strength carbon composites 
      and using liquid oxygen and methane as propellants for both stages.The flight 
      test program will begin in late 2024, followed by commercial flights in 2025.

      <p align="left">BW1 will lauched from Jeju Launch Center. Jeju launch site 
      offers different inclinations as well as different altitudes upon customer 
      request. The SSO capacity is further increased for launches in Esrange, as 
      it offers a more direct flight trajectory. Further increased capacity is available 
      by sacrificing the first stage recovery. For such a case, an additional ~20% 
      increase in payload capacity can be achieved.<br>
&nbsp;At Perigee, all structural members, including payload fairings, thrust frames, 
      and propellant tanks, are all made of carbon composites.</p>
      <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">BW1 is powered by nine &quot;Blue 1S&quot; main engines 
      and a single &quot;Skyblue&quot; upper-stage engine. developed and produced entirely 
      in-house. Blue 1S is a 30 kN thrust, turbopump-fed engine. With a chamber 
      pressure of 80 bar and a single shaft turbopump that runs at 50,000 rpm, the 
      engine is the smallest and the lightest powerplant ever built for an orbital 
      class booster.</p>
      <p align="left">Skyblue is a low-thrust, pressure-fed engine designed for 
      vacuum uses. The engine uses a spark ignition system capable of up to five 
      restarts. A pressure-fed cycle was selected for the ultimate simplicity of 
      the system. This, along with a single-element injector and an ablative chamber 
      design, makes Skyblue the most affordable and reliable engine for in-space 
      operations. </p>
