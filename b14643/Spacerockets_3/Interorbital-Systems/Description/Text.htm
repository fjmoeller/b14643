Systems (IOS) is developing a new generation of low-cost, rapid-response, orbital 
launch vehicles. NEPTUNE Modular Series rockets are designed for minimum cost and 
maximum reliability. Unnecessary, expensive, complex, failure-prone, and performance-limiting 
systems such as wings and turbopumps have not been included in the powerplant or 
architecture of IOS rockets. Since the NEPTUNE Modular Series launch vehicles are 
designed to be deployed from a private island launch site or from the open ocean, 
launch costs will be radically reduced (compared to standard spaceport fees), and 
launch scheduling will be based on customer demand (not on placement in a spaceport&#39;s 
launch rotation). The IOS modular rocket system is an evolved version of a similar 
system under development by OTRAG in the 1970&#39;s. <font color="#FF0000"><b>Lutz Kayser</b></font>, 
the former head of the OTRAG team, was an important consultant on the IOS project.<br>
<br>
Each member of the NEPTUNE Modular Series of launch vehicles is assembled from multiple 
Common Propulsion Modules (CPMs). Payload capacity can be varied by increasing or 
decreasing the number of CPMs and varying the burn times of each CPM in the array.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Each standard Common Propulsion Module is composed of two propellant tanks in tandem 
(or separately and parallel), a single throttleable, ablatively-cooled rocket engine, 
a valve unit, a gimbal system, and a controller. Depending on the configuration, 
the modules can operate in either blowdown or pressurant tank-fed modes. The capacity 
of the propellant tanks is regulated by varying their lengths. Construction costs 
are kept low using Minimum-Cost- Design rules, including use of off-the-shelf components 
and assembly-line/mass-production methodology. <br>
<br>
A single, throttleable liquid rocket engine powers each CPM. Thrusts will vary between 
7,500 and 15,000 pounds. When the CPMs are clustered in multiples of two or more 
per stage, gimballing provides pitch, yaw and roll control. Stand-alone CPMs have 
auxiliary on-off thrusters to provide roll control alone or pitch, yaw, and roll 
during a coast phase or for attitude control on-orbit. Storable, high-density<font color="#FF0000"> 
white fuming nitric acid (WFNA) and turpentine/furfuryl alcohol</font> are the CPM’s 
primary propellants. These low-cost, storable, environmentally-friendly propellants 
provide reliable and efficient hypergolic ignition. <br>

<b>NEPTUNE Building Block (NBB)</b><br>
The pressure-fed NBB is the primary propulsion module of the NEPTUNE series rockets.
</font><font size="2" color="#FF0000">Each standard NBB is composed of four propellant 
tanks (two fuel and two oxidizer tanks)</font><font size="2" color="#000080">, a 
single throttleable, ablatively-cooled, gimballed rocket engine, a valve unit, an 
optional roll system, and a controller. Construction costs are kept low by building 
the major rocket components in-house, using off-the-shelf components when necessary 
(for example: ball valves and micro-controller boards), and applying efficient automated 
mass-production methods.<br>
<br>
<b>NEPTUNE Nomenclature</b><br>
Each two-stage NEPTUNE rocket variant consists of two or more NBBs arranged side-by-side 
in parallel or stacked in tandem. The mission payload capacity is determined by 
the number of NBBs used in the launch-vehicle variant. Variants are designated by 
their NBB count. For example, a NEPTUNE 9 Two Stage, or N9TS, is assembled from 
nine NBBs. The minimum orbital flight configuration, the two-stage N2TS, has a two 
NBBs stacked in tandem. <br>
<br>
<b>Liquid Rocket Engines and Propellants</b><br>
A single, throttleable liquid rocket engine powers each NBB. Four thrust options 
are available for the NBB engines: </font><font size="2" color="#FF0000">1,000, 
7,500, 10,000, or 30,000 pounds of thrust (GPRE 1.0KNTA, GPRE 7.5KNTA, GPRE 10.0KNTA, 
or GPRE 30.0KNTA)</font><font size="2" color="#000080">. Storable, high-density 
white fuming nitric acid (WFNA) and turpentine power the NBB engines. These environmentally-friendly 
propellants provide reliable and efficient hypergolic ignition, eliminating the 
need for an ignition system. Each NBB&#39;s main rocket engine is gimballed to provide 
pitch, yaw and roll control (multiple NBBs). For a stand-alone NBBs (N2 variant), 
four cold-gas thrusters provide roll control. All IOS liquid rocket engines are 
ablatively cooled and are rapidly manufactured using a filament-winding process.</font></p>

<font size="2" color="#000080"><br>
<b>Pressure-fed System</b><br>
NEPTUNE rocket engines are pressure-fed. </font><font size="2" color="#FF0000">IOS 
has eliminated the requirement for a pump by developing ultra-lightweight filament-wound 
propellant tanks and by utilizing high-density propellants that substantially reduce 
the size of the propellant tanks.</font><font size="2" color="#000080"> The NEPTUNE 
pressurization system is lighter, less complex, and therefore cheaper and more reliable 
than equivalent pump-fed systems. Ablative-cooled and pressure-fed propulsion systems 
simplify the process of starting and stopping the rocket engines on the ground and 
in space.<br>
<br>
<b>Payload Capacity:</b> N2 Two Stage: 30.0-kg to 500 km polar orbit; N9 Two Stage: 
1, 250.0-kg to 500 km polar orbit; N36 Two Stage: 3,200.0-kg to 500-km polar orbit<br>
<b><br>
Materials</b><br>
Structural components are manufactured using mostly composite materials and aluminum. 
The propellant tanks and the rocket engine chambers and nozzles are filament wound 
using proprietary robotic technology.<br>
<br>
<b>Guidance</b><br>
IOS uses a guidance and control system developed in-house.<br>
<br>
<b>Ablatively Cooled Engine</b><br>

<b>Test Vehicles<br>
</b>First NBB Test Vehicle was launched in 2014. Its successful launch marked the 
first launch of a NEPTUNE variant and the first flight test of the NBB rocket engine. 
The IOS Neutrino rocket launch in 2018 was the first test of the NBB GPRE 1.0KNTA 
rocket engine.<br>

<p align="left" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0"><font size="2"><b>Common Propulsion 
Module</b><br>
The pressure-fed Common Propulsion Module, or CPM 2.0, is the primary building block 
of the NEPTUNE series rockets. Each standard Common Propulsion Module is composed 
of two oxidizer tanks, one fuel tank, and one pressurant tank, a single throttleable, 
ablatively-cooled, gimballed rocket engine, a valve unit, an optional roll system, 
and a controller. Construction costs are kept low by building the major rocket components 
in-house, using off-the-shelf subcomponents when necessary (for example: ball valves), 
and applying efficient mass-production techniques.<br>
<br>
<b>Upper Stages</b><br>
Depending on the mission requirements, one or two tandem upper stages may be required. 
These stages are stacked in series on the core CPM booster stage, and are activated 
after the first stage&#39;s burn is complete.<br>
<br>
<b>Liquid Rocket Engines and Propellants</b><br>
A single, throttleable liquid rocket engine powers each CPM. Two thrust options 
are available for the CPM engines: 7,500 or 15,000 pounds. Storable, high-density 
white fuming nitric acid (WFNA) and turpentine power the CPMs and the upper stages. 
These environmentally-friendly propellants provide reliable and efficient hypergolic 
ignition. The main rocket engine is gimballed to provide pitch and yaw control. 
For a standalone CPM (or any N1 configuration), four on/off bipropellant liquid 
hypergolic thrusters provide roll control. The tandem upper stages are each powered 
by a single liquid rocket engine with 1,000 pounds of thrust (vac).<br>
<br>
<b>Pressure-fed System</b><br>
NEPTUNE rocket engines use pressurized helium to maintain a constant propellant 
flow rate during engine operation. IOS has eliminated the requirement for a pump 
by developing ultra-lightweight filament-wound propellant tanks. The IOS pressure-fed 
system is lighter, less complex, and therefore cheaper and more reliable than equivalent 
pump-fed systems. Without pumps, NEPTUNE rockets can also avoid packing heavy batteries 
required to power standard turbopump pressure systems.<br>
<br>
<b>Materials</b><br>
Structural components are manufactured using primarily composite materials and aluminum. 
The launch vehicles&#39; lightweight propellant tanks have a filament-wound carbon outer 
shell and an aluminum inner shell that prevents leakage.<br>
The aluminum rocket engine injector components are mass produced using CNC methods. 
Other engine components, including the ablative engine combustion chamber and nozzles, 
are manufactured using filament winding and hand-layup manufacturing techniques.<br>
<br>
<b>NEPTUNE Nomenclature</b><br>
Each NEPTUNE rocket variant consists of one or more CPMs connected in parallel, 
and up to two tandem upper stages connected in series. The mission payload capacity 
is determined by the number of CPMs and upper stages used in the variant. Variants 
are designated by their CPM and upper stage count. For example, a NEPTUNE 5 US2, 
or N5 US2, contains five CPMs and two tandem upper stages. The minimum orbital flight 
configuration, the N1 US2, has a single CPM and two tandem upper stages, and can 
launch a 6.3 kg payload to a polar Low Earth Orbit.</font></p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0"><font size="2"><b>MOJAVE, 2018, Feb. 21 --
</b>The IOS rocket team successfully completed the first test of Interorbital&#39;s 
NEPTUNE series launch vehicle&#39;s liquid upper-stage rocket engine (GPRE 0.75KNTA). 
Engine performance was well within its design parameters, generating a sea-level 
thrust of 750 pounds and a sea-level specific impulse of 245 seconds. This translates 
to a thrust of 1,000 pounds and a specific impulse of 300 seconds in a vacuum (with 
expansion nozzle). The ablatively-cooled rocket engine is powered by the hypergolic 
combination of White Fuming Nitric Acid (WFNA) and Turpentine/Furfuryl Alcohol. 
These high-density storable auto-igniting propellants power all IOS liquid rocket 
engines. Interorbital&#39;s N1 launch vehicle utilizes two GPRE 0.75KNTA engines for 
its second stage and a single GPRE 0.75KNTA engine for its third stage.<b><br>

<br>
MOJAVE, 2017, July 25 </font></b><font size="2">-- The Interorbital team is nearing 
completion of its N1 GTV (NEPTUNE 1 Guided Test Vehicle which incorporates a high-efficiency 
CPM 2.0 filament-wound tank assembly, its new rocket engine gimbaling systems, its 
new CPM Controller, and a new in-house developed guidance system. The finless single 
CPM (Common Propulsion Module) launch vehicle will be used in an upcoming Q4 2017 
low-altitude flight test.<br>
During the test flight, the rocket will simulate an orbital launch trajectory by 
using the main rocket engine’s throttling capability to vary the thrust-to-weight 
ratio, thus simulating the actual conditions that will be experienced during an 
orbital launch.<br>
After the rocket passes through the transonic phase and Max Q, the engine will gradually 
throttle down, slowing the rocket until it begins to hover. At that point, the rocket 
engine will shut down and the rocket will be allowed to fall. At a safe altitude, 
a parachute will deploy for vehicle and payload recovery.<br>
Following the test of the N1 GTV launch vehicle, the IOS team will construct an 
orbital version of the N1, which consists of a single CPM 2.0 and two liquid upper-stages. 
It will be capable of placing a 14 pound (6.4 kg) payload into a 310 km polar orbit.<br>
As the N1 launch vehicle is 36 feet (11 meters) in length, and weighs only 5,400 
lbs (2449 kg), this will be the smallest orbital launch vehicle in the world. The 
same single Common Propulsion Module that powers the N1 can be bundled into groups 
of three, five, or eight to meet increased lift requirements for payloads weighing 
up to 500kgs (1,100-lbs).<br>
<b><br>
MOJAVE, 2017, Jan. 01</b> -- This year testing features field testing of all rocket 
systems including the guidance and control system for the NEPTUNE rocket series. 
Upon completion of these final ground tests, IOS will conduct a full-scale vehicle 
flight test of a guided CPM-G, as one of the milestones in IOS’ busy launch schedule 
for 2017.<br>
IOS is also completing the design of the hypergolic liquid version of the its common 
upper stage. A single CPM with two common upper stages will be launched to orbit 
after the low-altitude guidance flight tests have been completed. This launch vehicle 
has been designated the N1 LS2 LS3. This version is capable of launching a 4.5 kg 
payload to 310 km or a 3 kg payload to 550 km polar orbit.</font></p>

Systems developing a lunar impact mission that will be attempted in 2017. The mission, 
designated the &quot;Lunar Bullet,&quot; will feature a lunar-direct trajectory ending with 
a hard impact on the Moon&#39;s surface. <br>
The launch vehicle will be the IOS NEPTUNE 3 (N3) rocket, which will include an 
updated version of its Common Propulsion Module, the CPM 2.0. Each CPM 2.0 is assembled 
from an array of four carbon filament-wound tanks, a single gimballed engine, a 
valve and controller unit, and a fairing. The CPM 2.0&#39;s four-tank array includes 
propellants as well as pressurant gas to provide regulated pressurant flow during 
rocket engine operation. CPM 2.0 has been shown to have substantially improved engine 
performance. The N3 is a four-stage launch vehicle constructed by bundling three 
CPM 2.0s. The third- and fourth-stages are composed of a series of small&nbsp; IOS 
Minerva-I solid rocket motors (each 500 lb thrust, 26 lb propellant).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>MOJAVE, 2015, Febr. 14</b> -- Interorbital has 
completed the design of its unique 25-ton vertical ocean launch system and has begun 
its construction in Mojave. Upon completion and testing of the ocean-launch system, 
Interorbital will fly a guided version of the CPM TV to verify and flight-qualify 
both the guidance system and the ocean-launch system. That launch will take place 
from the Pacific Ocean west of the Port of Los Angeles. Interorbital will launch 
several commercial payloads on this test flight; both payloads and rocket are expected 
to be recovered. The following scheduled launch will be a full-performance CPM (the 
SR-145) targeting an altitude of 310-km with a 145-kg payload, again from the Pacific 
Ocean. </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2"><b>MOJAVE, 2014, April 29</b> -- Interorbital Systems’ 
Common Propulsion Module Test Vehicle (CPM TV) thundered off its mobile launch unit 
on its maiden flight. The rocket&#39;s 7,500-lb thrust engine performed flawlessly propelling 
the 1200-lb (0,544 t) rocket to Mach 1+ within seconds over the FAR Launch Area. 
The 30-foot long CPM TV rocket is a boiler-plate test version of the identical rocket 
units that will make up Interorbital&#39;s modular orbital launch systems.<br>
<br>
This unguided, fin-stabilized version of the CPM TV was controlled at the beginning 
of the launch by a unique cable guidance system that utilizes guide-arms attached 
to the bottom edge of the fins. Cables attached to the guide arms are wound around 
pulleys and a common drum, allowing the cables to unwind at the same rate, keeping 
the rocket flying straight until the fins become effective. This launch system is 
a low-mass equivalent of a 180-foot launch rail. The pyrotechnic guide-arm release 
system, which worked perfectly, is identical to the stage-release system that will 
be used by the IOS NEPTUNE orbital launch systems.<br>
<br>
A standard CPM is designed to burn its hypergolic liquid propellants (nitric acid 
and turpentine) for up to 150 seconds, which is enough to carry a 320-pound (145-kg) 
payload on a suborbital flight to an altitude of 192-miles (310-km). Because of 
the maximum altitude restrictions at the launch site, the burn time had to be limited 
to 10 seconds and ballast had to be added to the rocket to increase its weight. 
Due to a center of pressure anomaly, the rocket reached 10,000 feet (3 km), which 
was about half of its predicted altitude. The rocket&#39;s health and recovery system 
adapted to the problem and returned the rocket and its payloads safely to the ground.</font></p>
