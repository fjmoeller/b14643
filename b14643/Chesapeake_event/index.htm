          <p align="left"><font color="#000080">It is believed that the Chesapeake 
          structure, with its age of 35.3 million years, is one of the most recent 
          large impact crater on earth. However, seismic investigations and some 
          &quot;flat&quot; boreholes in which breccias were drilled are not sufficient to 
          confirm initial assumptions.<br>
          In 2005, the final proof was to be provided by a deep borehole in the 
          center of the structure. As part of the International Continental Scientific 
          Drilling Program (ICDP), the US Geological Survey induced the core drilling 
          Eyreville, with a depth of 1766 m.<br>
          <br>
          According to the scientific evaluation of the drill cores, it is believed 
          to now have the confirmation that the Chesapeake Bay structure actually 
          resulted from an impact event. This can be doubted, however, because once 
          again was ignored a clearly existing magmatic melt. It was not recognized 
          that the &quot;melt-rich suevites&quot; found in a depth range of 1397-1551 m are, 
          in fact, breccias infiltrated with a dacitic-rhyolitic magma.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#000080">This is the result by my investigation 
          of the many analyzes (BARTOSOVA et al.) of melts in this interval. They 
          confirm a dacitic-rhyolitic composition of the pure melt. A wide range 
          of deviating compositions of melts are the result of a mix of the dacitic-rhyolitic 
          melt with molten breccias. A special feature are pure silica fractions 
          (with very high SiO2 contents), as well as the cristobalite and tridymite 
          crystals grown during the cooling.</font></p>

          The last melt <font color="#FF0000">t<b>ype m6</b></font>, brownish melt 
          with typical globular texture, occurs exclusively in the upper impact 
          melt rock interval; it has 75 wt% SiO2 and the totals are approximately 
          96 wt%.</p>
          <p>The melt particle types exhibit rather distinct, yet partly overlapping 
          chemical compositions. However, compositions are quite variable among 
          melt particle types and individual melt particles of one type. Particles 
          display primary compositional differences (e.g., schlieren) due to mixing 
          of melt phases with different composition, and irregular distribution 
          of crystallites and undigested clasts. There are also secondary changes 
          due to hydrothermal alteration—the melt particles were altered to phyllosilicate 
          minerals, and secondary zeolites and anatase formed. Parts of the silica 
          melt recrystallized to ballen quartz, and rare ballen cristobalite was 
          also noted. Except for the nearly pure silica melt (melt type m3), no 
          mono-mineralic melts were found. The chemical analyses and mixing calculations 
          suggest that many of the melt types are relatively silica-rich. The pre-event 
          impact sedimentary formations (e.g., those similar to rocks from the Cretaceous 
          age) seem to have been main components for the melt types m1, m4 and m6.<br>
          The basement-derived schist or gneiss could also be a precursor for some 
          melt types (namely the most abundant melt types m2 and m5) according to 
          the calculations. However, microscopic observations of some partly melted 
          clasts and comparison of chemical composition of the melt particles and 
          sedimentary clasts from the Eyreville drill cores suggest that melt types 
          m2 and m5 possibly formed from a fine-grained, clay-rich sediment. Melt 
          type m3 is melted quartz, quartzite, or quartz arenite.<br>
          We suggest that the pre-event impact sediments are the most important 
          precursors for the identified melt types. The sediments constituted a 
          large part of the target (1 km thick) and were probably largely melted 
          or vaporized. However, according to the diagrams and mixing calculations 
          and given the dimensions of the crater, a crystalline basement (probably 
          schist &#8260; gneiss) precursor could have been involved in formation of some 
          melt particles. The composition of the melt particles is highly variable 
          and does not indicate a uniform homogenized melt source.<br>
          Alteration could have substantially changed the composition (by, e.g., 
          leaching of cations) of most melt types and makes the estimation of the 
          melt precursors difficult. The Eyreville drill cores provide only a limited 
          suite of samples for such a large impact structure and it is possible 
          that other types of melt particles or even larger melt bodies are present 
          in other parts of the Chesapeake Bay<i> </i>impact structure.</p>

          <p>X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy confirm a rare terrestrial 
          occurrence of monoclinic tridymite in clast-rich impact melt rock from 
          the Eyreville B drill core in the Chesapeake Bay impact structure. The 
          monoclinic tridymite occurs with quartz paramorphs after tridymite and 
          K-feldspar in a microcrystalline groundmass of devitrified glass and Fe-rich 
          smectite. Electron-microprobe analyses revealed that the tridymite and 
          quartz paramorphs after tridymite contain different amounts of chemical 
          impurities. Inspection by SEM showed that the tridymite crystal surfaces 
          are smooth, whereas the quartz paramorphs contain irregular tabular voids. 
          These voids may represent microporosity formed by volume decrease in the 
          presence of fluid during transformation from tridymite to quartz, or skeletal 
          growth in the original tridymite. Cristobalite locally rims spherulites 
          within the same drill core interval. <font color="#FF0000">The occurrences

          Their formation and preservation in an alkali-rich, high-silica melt rock

          <p>In drill core Eyreville B, the section of pre-resurge impactites (depth 
          of 1397-1551m) includes bodies of clast-rich, unbreccieted impact melt 
          rock of depths of 1402-1409.5 m as holocrystalline and at 1450-1451.5 
          m as hypocrystalline varieties. These bodies contain more massive impact 
          melt rock in their central parts, from 1450 to 1451.5 m (M1), and between 
          1402 and 1407.5 m (M2).<br>
          <b>Hypocrystalline clast-rich impact melt rock (M1)</b>:<br>
          <u>Macroscopically</u>, M1 is composed of fluidal-textured, banded, clear 
          to brown melt (30-70vol%) that entrained lithic clasts. Dark, fluidal 
          streaks in the rocks are partly fused remains of the fine clastic debris 
          or mafic components that were mixed into the melt. <u>Microscopically</u>, 
          the melt exhibits some glassy, clear domains that are isotropic and intergrown 
          by zoned orthopyroxene crystals that exhibit single-lath and dendritic 
          and euhedral, spinel crystals. In clear melt streaks, brown, spherolitic 
          aggregates of radially intergrown aluminosilicate microphenocrysts are 
          present. Dark, aphanitic streaks of melt contain euhedral Fe-Ti-O crystals, 
          few fan-like plagioclase phenocrysts, and small, equant quartz clasts 
          in a scmectitic groundmass.<br>
          Most quartz clasts exhibit a dark, bubbly contact aureole against the 
          melt but no halo of pyroxene crystals. Deplectic quartz glass was recrystallized 
          to polycrystalline&nbsp; ballen-textured quartz. The Raman spectroscopy 
          indicated the presence of alpha-quartz.<br>
          <b>Holocrystalline clast-rich impact melt rock (M2):<br>
          </b>This mostly holocrystallin, clast-rich, banded, massive gray<i>
          </i>impact melt rock is 5.5 m thick. Dark streaks are drawn out into discrete 
          strings and indicate little mixing with the typical gray melt matrix. 
          They are composed of similar components as the dark streaks in M1, except 
          for the smectite&nbsp; matrix, which is mostly overgrown with feldspar 
          crystals. Quartz clasts are generally subrounded, have a brownish tint, 
          and frequently display decorated PDFs. The M2 samples exhibit similar 
          phenocryst phases in the melt as M1. The melt rock matrix is fully crystallized.<br>
          <b>Electron microprobe data of the melts:<br>
          </b>The composition of clear, glassy melt was analyzed in pristine domains 
          of sample W84 from M1. The&nbsp; results indicate a peraluminous,
          <font color="#FF0000">rhyolitic composition</font> with a water content 
          of ~5%. The&nbsp; crystallized melt matrix in sample W61 from M2 indicate 
          a similar geochemical affinity.<br>
          Dark streaks in the melt rocks of M1 and M2 were analyzed. Analyses indicate 
          a reservoir for MgO, Al2O3, Fe and TiO2, whereas SiO2, Na2O3 and K2O are 
          dramatically depleted in the dark streaks compared to the composition 
          of the glassy, clear melt.</p>

              clearly allochthonous. This granitic slab is heterogenous and consists 
              of four intermingled granite types:<ul>
                <li>Gneissic biotite granite (mainly above 1216.5 m)</li>
                <li>Fine-grained biotite granite (widely dispersed)</li>
                <li>Medium- to coarse-grained biotite granite (mainly below 1216.5 
                m)</li>
                <li>A 7-m-thicvk basal zone of altered red biotite granite (below 
                1364 m)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The gneissic biotite granite has a sensitive high-resolution ion 
              microprobe (SHRIMP) U-Pb zircon age of 615 +/- 7 Ma (HORTON et al. 
              2007).<br>
              The medium- to coarse-grained biotite granite has a SHRIMP U-Pb zircon 
              age of 254 +/- 3 Ma (HORTON et al.)</p>
