    Galactic Energy Aerospace Technology</font> has stated that will developing 
    a larger liquid fuel launch vehicle, named Pallas-1.<br>
    <font size="1"><br>
    </font>The 42 metre high rocket will use kerosene and liquid oxygen propellant 
    and be capable of carrying a payload of up to four tonnes to low Earth orbit 
    (LEO) or two tonnes to 700 km altitude Sun-synchronous orbit (SSO).<br>
    <font size="1"><br>
    </font>The 3.35 diameter of the launcher is the same as many Long March vehicles, 
    developed by the main Chinese space programme contractor CASC, suggesting the 
    company has or will have access to such technology to assist its plans and development.<br>

    Energy Aerospace Technology Co. now has made a breakthrough in its Pallas-1 
    medium liquid-propellant reusable rocket.<br>
    The gas generator, which helps provide thrust to the rocket&#39;s 40-ton engine 
    that is powered by liquid oxygen and kerosene, has completed seven ignition 
    tests, with an accumulated operation time of 380 seconds, according to Galactic 
    Energy. The maximum single operation time lasted 100 seconds.<br>
    The company started developing the main rocket engine for the &quot;Pallas&quot; in December 
    2018, and it is the first Chinese rocket with engines that run of

    <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman">The next iteration of rockets by 
    Galactic Energy will be a medium-lift orbital launch vehicle. The Pallas-1 utilizes 
    RP-1 and liquid oxygen (Kerolox) in the first stage. The first stage leverages 
    seven Welkin variable thrust engines, legs, and grid fins to allow recovery 
    by vertical landing. <br>
    <font color="#FF0000">The Welkin 40-ton liquid oxygen/kerosene engine</font> 
    is testing in progress. On July 6, 2019, Galactic Energy disclosed completed 
    its first firing test of domestic liquid oxygen/kerosene engine key components. 
    The engine design includes a complex gas generator. <br>
    Recently, the independently developed Welkin liquid oxygen/kerosene engine large 
    range variable condition turbine pump components’ delivery has been completed, 
    and hydraulic tests will be carried out in the near future.<br>
    Welkin liquid oxygen/kerosene engine is the main engine of Pallas-1, which can 
    be reused 50 times. As the heart of the engine, the turbine pump is the only 
    component with a high spinning speed. It consumes high-pressure gas to drive 
    the turbine, makes the pump to rotate at high speed and push the pressurized 
    oxidant and fuel from the tank to the thrust chamber.<br>
    The independently R&amp;D Welkin liquid oxygen/kerosene engine large range variable 
    condition turbine pump is the first domestic double suction coaxial split turbine 
    pump, the structure forms of coaxial split (rigid shaft), liquid oxygen pump 
    double suction, turbine cantilever, membrane box seal and self-developed new 
    floating ring are adopted within. The innovative design significantly improves 
    the rotating speed, reduces the sealing pressure, improves the reliability, 
    and further simplifies the structure of the turbine pump.</font></p>
