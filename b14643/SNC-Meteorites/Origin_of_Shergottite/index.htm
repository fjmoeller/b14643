      <p align="left"><font color="#000080">Unfortunately, the interpretation of 
      the scientific investigations goes in the wrong direction, as so often. Some 
      authors are not open to new thinking. They can not imagine that the peculiarities 
      found (especially carbon matter) are indications that the shergottite is a 
      rock material from the mantle-sphere of Mars that has reached explosively 
      the surface.<br>
      A <u>biotic</u> origin of the carbon matter is doubtful, also the contamination 
      by carbonaceous chondrites. The carbon matter was original enclosed in veins. 
      The C isotopic compositions of the carbon matter are significantly different 
      to the Martian atmospheric CO2. The exceptionally young age of some Shergottites 
      (averaging 175 million years) proves that was still active volcanism on Mars 
      at that time. It is possible that the material direct entered into space. 
      The density of the Martian atmosphere at this time (Jurassic time on Earth) 
      was already very similar to today&#39;s. Due to differences in crystallization, 
      it is conceivable that a plug has initially formed in the crust, that was 
      then shoot by a new explosive magma thrust from the mantle to the surface.<br>
      <font size="1"><br>
      </font>The shock-induced, high-pressure phases in Martian meteorites are the 
      result of movements in the mantle magma. The high-P phases in Martian meteorites 
      include produced glass (maskelynite from plagioclase and pyroxene-composition 
      glass), ringwoodite (</font><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">&#611;</font><font color="#000080">-polymorph 
      of olivine), akimotoite (ilmenite structure of pyroxene), lingunite (Na-hollandite 
      structure of plagioclase), majorite (garnet structure of pyroxene), tuite 
      (</font><font color="#000080" face="Times New Roman">&#611;</font><font color="#000080">-polymorph 
      of merrillite), stishovite (&#945;-TiO<sub>2</sub> structure of quartz) and silicate 
      perovskite (perovskite structure of pyroxene). Most of the high-P phases are 
      polymorphs (more densely packed structure) than low-P minerals. These high-P 
      phases are typically small and were only observed in isolated occurrences 
      in or near shock-induced melts within the meteorites.</font></p>

          shock-melt veins and pockets and abundant fractures. It probably experienced 
          multiple shock events.<b><font color="#000080"><br>
          </font></b>Two distinct petrographic settings of carbonaceous grains were 
          found in the adhesive-free section of Tissint. Most carbonaceous matter 
          occurs as fine veins fully filling fractures and cleavages in olivine 
          and pyroxene, but not in maskelynite. These fractures and cleavages terminate 
          at the boundaries of maskelynite, a typical shock feature reported in 
          shergottites..<b><font color="#000080"><br>
          <font size="1"><br>
          </font></font></b>The carbonaceous components are kerogen-like, based 
          on micro-Raman spectra and multielemental ratios, and were probably deposited 
          from fluids in shock-induced fractures in the parent rock of Tissint. 
          After precipitation of the <i>organic matter (?)</i>, the rock experienced 
          another severe shock event, producing the melt veins that encapsulated 
          a part of the <i>organic matter (?)</i>.<br>
          <font size="1"><br>
          </font>Two types of carbonaceous matter were analyzed with laser micro-Raman 
          spectroscopy. The Raman spectra exhibit a broad G-band centered at 1580 
          cm<sup>-1</sup> and a smaller D-band at 1346 cm<sup>-1</sup>, similar 
          to those reported for carbon and clearly distinct from those of ordered 
          graphite. The <i>kerogen-like</i> carbon grains entrained in the shock-melt 
          veins have the same Raman spectra as those filling the fracture space, 
          except for the presence of a sharp band at 1327 cm<sup>-1</sup>, characteristic 
          of the diamond T<sub>2G</sub> mode and distinguished from the D-band at 
          1331 cm<sup>-1</sup> of the synthetic diamond used to polish the sections.
          <font color="#FF0000">This indicates a transformation of <i>kerogen-like 
          (?)</i> carbon to diamond at high pressure by a shock event and confirms 
          independent observations in other samples of Tissint as well as in NWA-6162 
          and NWA-856</font> (El Goresy et al. 2013b).<br>
          <br>
          We assert that the <i>organic</i> matter we found in Tissint is pristine 
          and is not terrestrial contamination.<br>
          We have confirmed this by the following lines of evidence: (1) it is deuterium-enriched; 
          (2) the presence of <i>organic matter</i> inclusions in shock-melt veins 
          indicates its formation before production of the veins by shock events 
          on Mars; (3)<font color="#FF0000"> partial conversion of the <i>organic 
          (?)</i> carbon inclusions entrained in the shock-melt veins to diamond 
          also points to strong pressure conditions.&quot;</font></td>

      <p align="left">&quot;NWA-6162 and NWA-856: These shergottites enclose a unique 
      type of broad shock-melt veins with a novel assemblage containing rosette-like 
      objects surrounded by comb-structured net-like pattern. Each of the polygonal 
      comb-like entities contains a small (&lt;2&#956;m) inclusion of carbon.
      <font color="#FF0000">Such bizarre carbon-bearing objects were never observed 
      before in any Martian meteorite</font>. Preliminary laser micro-Raman investigations 
      showed that some of the carbon inclusions in NWA-6162 depict the T<sub>2G</sub> 
      band of diamond at 1327 cm<sup>-1</sup> that shifted 5 wave numbers below 
      the characteristic Raman mode at 1331 cm<sup>-1</sup> and further shifted 
      to 1324 cm<sup>-1</sup> upon increase of the laser power thus confirming the 
      probable nano-sized diamond nature as previously demonstrated.
      <font color="#FF0000">This is the first report of shock-induced diamond in 
      a Martian sample</font>. We encountered in NWA-856 orderly arranged carbon 
      particles also in comb-like objects in rows in a shock-melt pool. Nature of 
      the carbon particles in Tissint, NWA 6162 and NWA 856 are under investigation 
      and are subject of further detailed Raman study and isotopic scrutiny by NanoSIMS 
      50L.&quot;</p>
