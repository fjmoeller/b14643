      <p><font color="#000080">The Cretaceous/Tertiary boundary characterizes one 
      of the five great mass extinction in Earth&#39;s history. It is believed that 
      these faunas-cut was caused by the impact of an asteroid on the Yucatan Peninsula 
      65 million years ago (Chicxulub-impact). Exposed sediment series in the Cretaceous/Tertiary 
      transition in the world were associated with this scenario. In many outcrops 
      at the K/T-boundary were detected worldwide ejecta (glassy spherules) and 
      elevated iridium concentrations. As type locality (Global Standard Stratotype 
      Section and Point, GSSP) defines the K/T-boundary the profile El Kef (Tunisia) 
      with a so-called &quot;Boundary Tone&quot;.<br>
      <font size="1"><br>
      </font>Since the results of biostratigraphic analysis of borehole Yaxcopoil-1 
      on Yucatan (2004) were published, began a controverse debate about the causal 
      relations between Chicxulub event and K/T-boundary.<br>
      The group Keller/Stinnesbeck/Addate doubt this context. They are convinced 
      that they have detected in the core from the borehole Ya-1 above the ejecta 
      (breccias) about 0.50 m Cretaceous sediments with foraminifera in situ. That 
      would mean that the Chicxulub event has to do with the K/T-boundary nothing. 
      The advocates of causal relations between Chicxculub event and K/T-boundary 
      try to discredit these results.<br>
      <font size="1"><br>
      </font>Apart from the K/T debate, the author doubts that the Chicxulub crater 
      in Yucatan documents the impact of an asteroid with massive global effects. 
      The detection of an andesitic melt in the center of the crater (with dioritic 
      magma chamber in the underground) suggest the explosion of a supervolcano. 
      It is absolutely inconceivable that an andesitic melt is compatible to molten 
      dolomites or limestone as target-rocks by an impact. Gravimetric investigations 
      on Yucatan, suggest that the former magma chamber is not limited under the 
      center of the crater. Possibly a large magma chamber in the crust reach far 
      to south. The presumed &quot;peak ring&quot; in the center of the crater is an illusion 
      and was undetectable by drilling. Finally, the arguments of the advocates 
      for an impact origin of the Chicxulub are not convincing, more shaky, because:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font color="#000080">Iridium is not only an indicator of &quot;young&quot; extraterrestrial 
        material. It is been since the creation of the planet exists in its liquid 
        core.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#000080">Planar deformation or shock-generated features 
        are equal indicators of volcanic eruptions, or shock waves by magma movements.</font></li>
        <li><font color="#000080">As with other supposedly large impact structures, 
        it was also in this case not possible to reach a geochemical correlation 
        between target-rocks and &quot;impact&quot;-melt.<br>
        (therefore also the &quot;<a target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240626212653/http://www.b14643.de/Tektites/index.htm">Tektites</a>&quot; 
        are of volcanic origin)</font></li>
        <li><font color="#000080">The so-called impact-melt in the Chicxulub is 
        clearly of magmatic origin (pure andesite in the depth of about 1400 m). 
        The significance of this fact is completely ignored.<br>
        The found glasses are either geochemically compatible with the andesitic 
        melt or are a mix with molten bedrock.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font color="#000080">Due to the andesitic melt in the crater there have 
      been only a influences from inside to outward. Probably a huge overpressure 
      explosion took place, by this the bedrock was destroyed and the debris were 
      widely distributed. The strewn field extends to Belize, Guatemala and southern 
      Mexico. The detected andesitic melt ascended after the explosion and is secondarily 
      penetrated in parts of the breccia and the bedrock (Veins, Dykes). It is also 
      likely that falling-back debris are sunken primarily in the melt and were 
      partially melted.<br>
      <br>
      The effect of Chicxulub event is limited. In the Caribbean or Central America 
      in the studied outcrops are no clear evidence of Tsunami sediments that have 
      something to do with the Chicxulub event. The strewn field of the Chicxulub 
      breccia is relatively limited. There is no evidence of eruptive melt in breccias 
      outside the crater on Yucatan. The presence of glassy spherules and volcanoclasts 
      in the studied outcrops in Central America and Caribbean is very diverse and 
      marked a longer period of the Upper Cretaceous to Paleocene. For this and 
      for the iridium concentrations, a persistent regional volcanism may be considered.<font size="1"><br>

          </span>IODP Expedition 364 aims to drill into the Chicxulub impact structure 
          to recover cores from, and above, the <b>&quot;peak ring&quot;</b>. The expedition

          at site about 30km northwest of Progreso, Mexico, on the Yucatan shelf, 
          Gulf of Mexico. Date: <b><font color="#FF0000">1st April to 31st May 2016</font>.<br>
          </b></i><b>Working hypothese</b><br>
          Chicx-03A will sample the material that forms a topographic peak ring. 
          It will test the working hypotheses that peak rings are formed from: 1) 
          overturned and uplifted upper, mid, or lower crustal basement rocks, 2) 
          mega-breccias, or 3) some other material. One intrinsic feature of the 
          peak ring is that it is a seismic low-velocity zone, despite some models 
          predicting it consists of lithologies from the formerly deeply buried 
          basement of the Yucatan. Sampling these lithologies will test the hypothesis 
          that peak rings consist of lithologies that are deeply sourced but heavily 
          brecciated and, hence, have higher porosities than surrounding impact 
          and target rocks. This hypothesis, if correct, has consequences for questions 
          of peak rings serving as habitat for exotic microbiology, due to the potential 
          existence of macro-porosity, in the presence of significant hydrothermal 
          circulation.<br>
          Chicx-04A will penetrate the enigmatic dipping reflectors (1200 – 1400 
          m) that run from the outer edge of the peak ring and dip inwards. It will 
          test whether the dipping reflectivity beneath the peak ring is: 1) a lithologic 
          boundary between uplifted basement lithologies and younger Mesozoic sediments, 
          2) is a thrust fault formed during peak ring emplacement, 3) is the result 
          of vigorous hydrothermal circulation in the wake of peak ring emplacement.<br>

      </font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#000080">Drilling programs have 
      been conducted as part of the <b>PEMEX</b> oil exploration surveys, the <b>
      UNAM</b> Chicxulub Program, the Federal Commission of Electricity exploration 
      program (<b>FCE-UNAM</b>) and the international Chicxulub Scientific Drilling 
      Project (<b>CSDP</b>).<br>
      Several exploratory wells were drilled by Petroleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) in and 
      around the structure. Three of the boreholes (Yucatan-6, Chicxulub-1, and 
      Sacapuc-1) penetrated a melt rock that was interpreted to be an extrusive 
      (volcanic) andesite. Further examination of samples from the Yucatan-6 borehole, 
      however, revealed shocked quartz in a polymict breccia that overlays a thick 
      melt unit in the interior of the structure, indicating that the Chicxulub 
      structure is an impact crater (and this was an error). Because Yucatan-6 was 
      an oil exploration borehole, and much of the cored material has been lost. 
      The same situation exists for two other exploration boreholes drilled within 
      the rim of the structure (Chicxulub-1 and Sacapuc-1) and five boreholes drilled 
      outside the structure (Ticul-1, Yucatan-1, -2, -4, and 5A.<br>
      The first effort to obtain such cores was initiated by the Universidad Nacional 
      Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), which began a shallow drilling program that has 
      recovered additional samples of &quot;impact&quot; breccias in 3 boreholes outside the 
      rim of the crater. Recovery depths range from ~60 m to ~700 m.<br>
      However, several deep boreholes are still needed to penetrate melt or breccia 
      lithologies within the center of the crater. The first of these is called 
      the Chicxulub Scientific Drilling Project (CSDP), which was drilled as part 
      of the International Continental Drilling Program (ICDP) in a coordinated 
      effort with UNAM.</font></p>

      m), <b>Sacapuc-1</b> (1,530 m) and <b>Yucatan-6</b> (1,645 m) drilled into 
      a unit of igneous-textured rocks. The melt unit presents a minimum thickness 
      of about 250 m. The breccias section is about 250-400 m thick in these boreholes. 
      The breccias section was also cut in boreholes outside the basin at increasing 
      distance away from the crater center in boreholes Ticul-1 (3,175 m), Yucatan-2 
      (3,488 m), Yucatan-5A (3,003 m), Yucatan-1 (3,226 m) and Yucatan-4 (2,425

      grained coherent microcrystalline matrix.&nbsp; Breccias contain fine-grained 
      altered melt clasts dispersed in a medium-to-coarse grained matrix of pyroxene 
      and feldspar. Clasts contain fragments of basement silicate material (<b>granitic 
      gneiss, amphibolite</b>). Melt and breccias in Yucatan-6 extend from about 
      1,100 m to more than 1,400 m; sequence is well-sorted with an apparent gradation. 
      They also reported observations on shock mosaicism and diaplectic glasses. 
      Samples from Chicxulub-1 N10 and Yucatan-6 N19 were analyzed for iridium contents. 
      Iridium abundances were relatively high with variable contents. <i>However, 
      these both factors are not only relevant as evidence of an impact event.</i></font></p>

      The observed <b>&quot;suevite&quot;</b> of borehole Yucatan-6 is clearly stratified 
      in terms of composition, grain size, type of matrix and concentration of melt 
      material. Three distinct types of &quot;suevite&quot; breccia can be identified:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="2" color="#000080">An upper &quot;suevite&quot; 
        (carbonate-rich). Small densely packed carbonate clasts clearly dominate 
        over crystalline basement fragments. The clasts are embedded in a porous,
        <u>10 micron-size matrix</u>. This &quot;suevite&quot;&nbsp; represents a fall-back 
        material.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="2" color="#000080">A middle &quot;suevite&quot; 
        (clast-rich). The silicate basement clasts and altered silicate melt fragments 
        increase in proportion with depth. The clasts are suspended in a more compacted 
        and much less <u>porous matrix</u>.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Times New Roman" size="2" color="#000080">A lower &quot;suevite&quot; 
        (thermometamorphic). This is composed of basement and evaporite clasts and 
        abundant silicate melt fragments. The <u>matrix is completely crystalline</u> 
        and consists of euhedral feldspar and pyroxene grains.</font></li>

      the melt rocks, already described by Kring and Boynton (1992), Schuryatz et 
      al. (1994), and Warren et al. (1996). It appears to have reacted with the 
      underlying hot andesitic melt-rock matrix. Samples of melt clasts, glasses, 
      melt rocks and melt matrix separates were analyzed for major oxides (Sharpton 
      et al., 1992; Sigurdsson et al., 1991; Izett et al., 1990; Claeys et al.,

          stratigraphy in this zone. <br>
          <br>
          Only the borehole Valladolid BEV-4 cored a&nbsp; 34 m thick section of
          <b>breccias</b> between 250 to 284 m deep, which is part of the proximal 
          ejecta blanket deposits. Breccias are characterized by abundant clasts 
          of limestone, dolomite, gypsum and anhydrite.</font><p>&nbsp;</p>

              contain melt clasts that are usually pink, brown, or green in colour, 
              amidst a dark brown or green matrix. Previous authors reported these 
              laths to be plagioclase, orthoclase, potassium feldspar, and rare 
              pyroxene (Dressler et al., 2004; Kring et al., 2004; Tuchscherer et 
              al., 2004a; Wittmann et al., 2004). Most of the laths consist of plagioclase 
              with consistent compositions between the rim and centre of the clasts. 
              In addition, near the rim of the melt clasts, the tabular laths are 
              often consistent with a potassium feldspar composition (adularia) 
              coincident with a general enrichment of K along these rims. <br>
              The clasts and matrix in samples from unit 5 have very different major 
              element signatures. Multiple generations of Mg-rich phyllosilicate 
              are present in the samples. In terms of weight percent abundances, 
              MgO concentrations in the matrix phyllosilicate range from 15 to 30 
              wt.%. In contrast, the melt clasts contain 0–5 wt.% MgO. MgO and Al2O3 
              are spatially decoupled, as Al2O3 has a range of about 15–25 wt.% 
              and is concentrated in melt clasts. The matrix, in contrast, contains 
              Al2O3 concentrations ranging from below detection limit to 11 wt.%. 
              Melt clasts in unit 5 contain a large range of SiO2 concentrations, 
              from about 54 to 66 wt.%, whereas the matrix contains 37–50 wt.% based 
              on point analyses. There is an enrichment of K2O on most of the edges 
              of the melt clasts forming an enriched rim typically 50–100 and sometimes 
              up to 400 µm. In addition, the rims of both the large melt clasts 
              and the small melt particles floating in the matrix contain or are 
              covered with laths of K2O-rich adularia. The Mg-rich matrix material 
              itself is very poor in K2O, often containing K2O values below detection 
              limits. However, FeO is enriched in the matrix compared to the melt 
              clasts.</font></p>

              Unit 3 (US)</b><br>
              This 23 m-thick melt-rich unit of breccias is dominated by fragments 
              of altered silicate melt, generally with microcrystalline textures. 
              Although some fragments appear to have been partly to wholly glassy 
              before being replaced by phyllosilicates and calcite. Primary minerals 
              in the microcrystalline melts include pyroxene, plagioclase and alkali 
              feldspar. Some of these silicate melts contained immiscible carbonate 
              melt, gas vesicles (some of which were subsequently filled with secondary 
              calcite and silicates), and flow-aligned crystals. In general, these 
              melt fragments are more vesicular than those in the overlying suevitic 
              units. The melt fragments in this breccia section entrained feldspar, 
              quartz, magnetite, lithic metaquartzites, micritic carbonate, shale, 
              and crystalline mafics.<br>
              The textural distinction between solidified silicate melt with immiscible 
              carbonate melt and solidified silicate melt with gas vesicles subsequently 
              filled with calcite is subtle. Ellipsoids of carbonate protruding 
              from the edges of silicate melt fragments into the breccia matrix 
              indicate that the carbonate was solid before the fragmentation of 
              the melt fragment and incorporation into the breccia. In this case, 
              the carbonate is a primary phase and was immiscible when the melts 
              were molten. Ellipsoids of carbonate completely bounded by silicate 
              melt could also represent immiscible carbonate melt but, in these 
              cases, could instead be ellipsoids of secondary carbonate filling 
              gas-evacuated vesicles.&quot;<b><br>
              Unit 4 (MS)</b><br>
              A 15 m-thick breccia was logged immediately above the green melt unit 
              with abundant and sometimes very large (up to 20 cm) clasts of banded 
              melts. The melt is dominated by microcrystalline, pyroxene, plagioclase, 
              and alkali feldspar. Similar to the green melt, although the color 
              (shades of rose) is different. The melt entrained small amounts of 
              shocked and unshocked clasts of quartz, feldspar, sandstone, metaquartzite, 
              and granite. These melt fragments exist in a breccia that is variously 
              clast and matrix supported, the latter of which appears to have been 
              a conduit for fluids and is now charged with secondary alkali feldspar 
              and subordinate carbonate.<b><br>
              Unit 5 (BMR)</b><br>
              &quot;The green melt is generally massive in appearance, but contains flow 
              lines on both macroscopic and microscopic scales that are suggestive 
              of incompletely mixed and rapidly quenched melt. No fresh glasses 
              were observed. The melt is dominated by microcrystalline, Ca-rich 
              pyroxene, plagioclase and alkali feldspar. Granitic clasts up to 4.5 
              cm and mafic clasts up to 6.5 cm were observed. In thin section, small 
              amounts of shocked and unshocked clasts are entrained in the melt, 
              including quartz and quartzite with planar deformation features and 
              ballen structures after cristobalite, isolated altered feldspar and 
              mafic minerals, and mafic lithics. Inclusions within the thin section 
              are aligned, as in a trachytic texture, implying that <u>the melt 
              was flowing before solidification</u>. The green melt is also brecciated 
              and highly altered along its margins where the contacts were conduits 
              for carbonate-rich fluids. While the core was being recovered, a 10 
              m-thick carbonate-charged and brecciated green impact melt unit (unit 
              6) with larger clasts, including a 34 cm granite, was logged below

          <b>Types of Melt Particles</b><br>
          &quot;<u>Type 1</u> melt particles are brownish to pale green and lack any 
          primary crystallization, except remnants of devitrification spherulites. 
          The shape of these fragments is subrounded in most cases and rarely angular. 
          Some large vesicles can occur, and particle margins may display porosity 
          at the micrometer scale, both indicating degassing during cooling of the 
          melt. Melt particles of type 1 have only been observed in samples from 
          the upper three suevite units with a rough trend of decreasing frequency 
          from top to bottom.<br>
          <u>Type 2</u> melt particles are also pale green to brownish in color 
          and may contain abundant vesicles, up to about 30 vol%. Smaller particles 
          frequently exhibit angular shard-like shapes that probably formed due 
          to broken-up vesicles. Some plagioclase microphenocrysts occur, in contrast 
          to melt particles of type 1. Rims of melt particle shards are frequently 
          enriched in plagioclase microphenocrysts. Similar to type 1, the melt 
          particles of type 2 were only observed in the upper three suevite units.<br>
          <u>Type 3</u> melt particles are the most common in all suevite units, 
          except in unit 1, where type 1 and 2 dominate. Type 3 melt particles are 
          greenish to brown-beige colors and display sizes up to several cm. They 
          comprise a variety of shapes in units 2 to 4, including uniform sub-rounded, 
          elongated, lumpy, elongated, and twisted forms, and more angular forms 
          in units 5 and 6. Type 3 melt particles are moderately to nearly completely 
          crystallized with plagioclase and clinopyroxene laths, commonly displaying 
          flow textures. An increase in the degree of crystallization with depth 
          is evident from the samples of suevite units 2 to 4. Within units 4, 5, 
          and 6, melt particles of type 3 are generally well crystallized (but aphanitic). 
          Clinopyroxene is abundant in melt particles at the lowest two units of 
          the suevitic sequence. In units 2 to 4, microphenocrysts of clinopyroxene 
          were only observed as inclusions within patches of secondary K-feldspar 
          in type 3 melt particles.<br>
          <u>Type 4</u> melt particles are dark brown to nearly opaque, subrounded 
          to subangular in shape, and always display an aphanitic texture. They 
          are generally rich in clasts of silicate or carbonate minerals (mostly 
          quartz, feldspar, and calcite.&quot;<font color="#000080"> </font></font>

          Melt particles</b><br>
          &quot;With some exceptions, most melt particles display SiO2 contents between 
          57 and 63 wt%, which represents the typical <u>range of andesites</u>.<br>
          Many of the other major element contents of the melt particles exhibit 
          a wide range. These include the alkalies that are very sensitive to hydrothermal 
          alteration. Therefore, any rock classification based on these elements 
          has to be performed with caution. For example, the extension of melt particle 
          compositions from the andesite field toward the trachyandesite and trachyte 
          field can be attributed to potassium enrichment during hydrothermal alteration. 
          Most melt particles exhibit relatively high Al2O3 and MgO contents compared 
          to the continental crust and average impact melt rocks.</font><font size="2" color="#000080"><br>
          </font><font size="2">The type 1 and 2 melt particles follow a similar 
          compositional trend that is different from type 3 and 4 particles. Type 
          1 and 2 are significantly depleted in CaO and Na2O compared to the average 
          continental crust and (impact) melts from Chicxulub and other large craters 
          world-wide. Furthermore, type 1 and 2 melt particles display a rather 
          wide range in FeO und K2O contents with a distinct trend of FeO and K2O 
          enrichment with SiO2 and Al2O3 depletion.<br>
          The melt particles of type 3 show the largest variation in chemical composition, 
          which is related to the degree of primary crystallization (plagioclase 
          and clinopyroxene) and the intensity of hydrothermal alteration. Particles 
          in the upper suevite units, that only contain a few plagioclase microphenocrysts, 
          have low CaO and Na2O and elevated FeO and MgO contents similar to those 
          of type 1 and 2 particles. Particles with abundant clinopyroxene microphenocrysts 
          have the highest CaO contents.<br>
          These melt particles are closest in composition to CaO-rich samples of 
          the (impact) melt rocks derived from the Y-6 drill site with the exception 
          of MgO, which is much higher in melt particles from Yax-1.<br>
          On average, K2O is enriched in melt particle type 3 compared to the continental 
          crust and average (impact) melt rock, although patches of secondary Kfeldspar 
          were not included in the microprobe analyses of melt particles, where 
          they could be avoided. Melt particles of the lower suevite (unit 6) are 
          pervasively altered by K-feldspar. In this case, secondary K-feldspar 
          could not be avoided from the chemical analysis, which is evident from 
          their high K2O contents. Most of the melt particles of type 3 have much 
          higher MgO, and slightly lower FeO contents.<br>
          Compositions of the dark aphanitic melt particles (type 4) are closest 
          to the average continental crust and average (impact) melt rock, although 
          Al2O3 is enriched and SiO2 is depleted in comparison. Most particles of 
          type 4 are andesitic and very similar in composition. One particle has 
          a higher SiO2 content and resembles a dacite in composition, although 
          the FeO, MgO, and TiO2 contents are rather high for a typical dacite. 
          Two particles plot in the trachyandesite field; however, some secondary 
          potassium enrichment can not be excluded.&quot;<br>
          </font><font size="2" color="#000080"><br>
          </font><font size="2"><b>Primary Composition of Impact Melts</b><br>
          &quot;The determination of the primary impact melt composition is rather problematic 
          in an environment in which significant post-impact hydrothermal alteration 
          has occured.<br>
          Since hydrothermal mass transfer was shown to be important in those melt 
          particles that were least crystallized before the onset of post-event 
          alteration, we focus on the best crystallized melt particles of type 3 
          and on dark aphanitic melt particles (type 4), which show the least evidence 
          of any alteration.<br>
          <u>Most of the least-altered melt particles are andesitic in composition</u>. 
          One melt particle of type 4 possesses a higher dacitic SiO2 content, indicating 
          that more acidic target (?) lithologies may locally be involved and were 
          not homogenized to the bulk andesitic impact melt. The compositional range 
          of the (impact) melt particles is consistent with previous studies on 
          (impact) melts at Y-6 and C-1. The melt particles of type 3 with a high 
          modal amount of clinopyroxene and relatively high CaO and low SiO2 contents, 
          similar to those found at Y- 6, might suggest the presence of mafic lithologies 
          in the target (?) rocks, e.g., basalts or basaltic andesites. Contribution 
          of a mafic precursor component was proposed for the Chicxulub impact melt 
          by Kettrup et al. (2000) and for Chicxulub-related spherules by Schulte 
          et al. (2003). However, petrological studies on the Ca-rich impact melt 
          rocks at Y-6 demonstrate that a possible contribution of mafic rocks (diabases, 
          pyroxenites, or amphibolites) must have been limited (Kring and Boynton 
          1992). We propose that the elevated CaO (and MgO) contents and reduced 
          SiO2 contents in the melt that characterize these clinopyroxene-rich particles 
          result from the mixing of the silicate basement rocks with the overlying 
          carbonate sequences.&quot; </font><font size="2" color="#000080"><br>

          </font></b><font color="#000080">The whole debate about the genesis of 
          drilled melt and breccias in the Chicxulub crater is conducted with <b>
          wrong assumptions</b>. The Chicxulub &quot;impact&quot; crater is in fact the <b>
          caldera of a supervolcano</b> that is created by a huge overpressure explosion. 
          The volcanic origin is by drilled <b>pure andesite</b> in the center of 
          the structure no doubt proved. The bedrock was blasted in a great extent 
          and widely distributed.</font></p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080">Gravimetric 
          investigations on Yucatan, suggest that the former magma chamber is not 
          limited under the center of the Chicxulub crater. Possibly the dioritic 
          magma chamber reach far to south. It is possible that the crater to south 
          is open (no boreholes). That would be one explanation for the thick breccia 
          units in Guatemala and South-Mexico.</font></p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080">The ascending 
          andesitic melt in the center of the explosion had only a low eruptive 
          potential. There is no evidence of eruptive melt in the breccias outside 
          the crater on the Yucatan peninsula (questionable Y-5A). The caldera after 
          the explosion was immediately covered with falling-back debris. The detection 
          of dykes or veins in the bedrock (Ya-1) indicates lateral intrusions from 
          the yet not cooled andesitic melt body (mixed with breccia). In two wells 
          (C-1, Y-1) were found &quot;ash with glass&quot; in depths between 1300 and 1400 
          m. This is mysterious and would be worth a new analysis.<br>
          There are two different types of breccias from the ruined bedrock. There 
          are breccias above the intact bedrock and breccia above the igneous andesite. 
          The breccias above the bedrock has no contact with the melt and are unchanged. 
          The breccias above the andesite (S-1, C-1, Y-1 wells) are melted or are 
          in contact with melt, in decreasing intensity upwards. Possibly the lowest 
          parts of falling-back debris are already fallen in the andesitic melt. 
          A sorting the breccias (called units) make not sense because convective 
          movements in the melt are expected. In the upper part of the breccia-package 
          are smaller components of falling-back debris concentrated and have already 
          stratification. Glass fragments in the melted breccias-package are geochemically 
          different. These fragments belong as the breccia to the falling-back debris 
          after the explosion. Presumably, these glasses come from a mixed melt 
          of igneous andesite and bedrock on top of the eruptive vent. All the others 
          in Central America found glassy spherules and glass fragments have probably 
          not a connection with the Chicxulub event (see below).<br>
          The occurrence of shock-generated features is not only an indicator for 
          an impact event, because this is also proved by finds in volcanic structures.Very

      </font></b><font color="#000080">PEMEX investigators of the l970’s (Meyerhoff 
      et al and Lopez-Ramos) reported limestones with diverse <u>planktic foraminiferal 
      assemblages of upper Maastrichtian age</u> overlying the breccia in wells 
      Chicxulub-1 and Yucatan-6. An interval of 18 m-thick Maastrichtian marls overlying 
      the &quot;impact&quot; breccia at the C-1 well. It was identified the planktic foraminiferal 
      species <i>Globotruncana rosetta, G. ventricosa, G. lapparenti, G. fornicata, 
      Pseudoguembelina excolata, Heterohelix globocarinata, Pseudotextularia elegans, 
      Planoglobulina carseyae</i>, and <i>Globigerinelloides volutus</i> in this 
      interval and conclude that the Chicxulub event occurred before the K/T-boundary.<br>
      By <b>Keller et al</b> (2004) in <b>Yaxcopoil-1</b>, unit 794.60-794.11m, 
      detected <u>Maastrichtian foraminifera</u> are unfortunately dolomitic crystallized 
      and give rise to discussion. <b>Smit</b> interpret these forms as dolomite 
      rhombs.<br>
      Nevertheless, the conclusions of Keller et al. are right, and the Chicxulub 
      event has nothing to do with the K/T-boundary. The K/T-boundary is biostratigraphically 
      in profile clearly placed 0.50 cm above the breccias. The discussed sediments 
      in the unit above the breccia are no catastrophic or hardground deposits (in 
      sense <b>Smit</b>), they in contrary are layered in a normal marine milieu 
      with moderatly movements during a longer period of time (300 000 years). A 
      portion of the sediments shows millimeter fine laminations. This indicates 
      slightly increased water-energy for the deposition of sediments. Moreover, 
      in the sediments was bioturbation detected. It is also normal that at the 
      beginning various reworked material of limestone and dolomite debris was deposited 
      mainly. Striking are inserted thin layers of green clay (or glauconite) indicate 
      altered sedimentation conditions. The last &quot;green clay&quot; layer (794.12m) is 
      markedly and could be the equivalent of the &quot;Boundary Tone&quot;. The bubblelike 
      inclusions in the greenish layer could be spherules from the widespread post-Chicxulub 
      volcanism. A significant time gap is possible because the following marine 
      sediments suddenly documented a changed marine milieu.<br>

      the Yaxcopoil-1 unit 794.60-794.11m are not right. They confirmed <u>unintentionally</u> 
      the thesis of Keller el al., because the detected <u>Cretaceous foraminifera 
      are not reworked</u>. They are <u>in good condition</u>. A reworking during 
      the postulated catastrophic crater infilling (where are breccias) would have 
      destroyed these filigree casings. Furthermore, how it should be possible these 
      originally in the limestone embedded casing undamaged to isolate after a short 
      time. The postulated mixed reworking assemblage of foraminifers (Albian-Turonian 
      and Campanian-Maastrichtian) should be evaluated with caution. There are also 
      long-lived Cretaceous species therein.<br>

          &quot;The Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary stratigraphy in north (Albion) and central 
          (Armenia) Belize encompasses the Maastrichtian dolomite and overlying 
          diamictite layer with basal spheroid bed. The northern Albion <b>spheroid-bearing 
          clay layer</b> rests directly upon Maastrichtian dolostones and consists 
          of brown to rust-colored clay, which is locally rich in oblate, pebble-size 
          dolomitic spheroids. Near the bed base, it is rich in irregular red or 
          green clay clasts. This whole clay layer ranges from 15 to 150cm thick. 
          The basal contact is sharp and is usually marked by a paper-thin hematitic 
          rind on the underlying Maastrictian dolostone. The spheroid-bearing clay 
          layer is highly deformed. Studies of associated red and green clay clasts 
          suggest that they are glass fragments that have been altered. This green 
          clay clasts (clay spheroids) are <b>smectites</b>.</font></p>
          <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
          <font size="2" color="#000080">The <b>diamictite unit</b> rests directly 
          upon the spheroid-bearing clay layer and consists of light tan, moderately 
          indurated and matrix-rich, poorly sorted breccia. The diamictite unit 
          contains at least 5 individual beds. Each of these beds ranges from 2 
          to 7 meters thick. Within individual beds, crude grading (with floating 
          boulder clasts near or at the top of beds) is common.&nbsp; As part of 
          the crude grading, boulders located at the base of some beds show imbrication 
          and clast support. Other internal structures are crude flow laminations, 
          which are located in the upper one to 2 meters of each bed. Some beds 
          have rare megaboulders&nbsp; near their bases or tops. Other beds contain 
          rare matrix-coated boulders up to 3 m in diameter. Diamictite matrix is 
          mainly highly comminuted dolomite in the silt-clay size range. Matrix 
          content commonly equals approximately 50 to 70 percent of the rock and 
          matrix is more abundant near the tops of most beds. This matrix contains 
          some red and green clay clasts, similar to those found within the underlying 
          spheroid-bearing clay layer. These clay clasts are thought to have a similar 
          origin to the ones mentioned earlier from within the spheroid-bearing 
          clay layer. Red and green clay clasts are much more common in the lower 
          2 to 3 meters of the diamictite unit matrix. Comparison of underlying 
          Maastrichtian dolomitic facies and lithologies of diamictite clasts shows 
          significant differences.&quot;<br>

          has figured prominently in the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary controversy 
          as a result of the discovery of <b>clay spheroids </b>and <b>diamictite</b> 
          in the Albion Island and Armenia outcrops. <br>
          In the Albion Island quarry the spheroid layer overlies Maastrichtian 
          dolomite and is between 1 and 2 m thick with some bedding features. This 
          layer is characterized by abundant rounded to subangular bodies (or clasts) 
          of dolomite and clay up to 2 cm in diameter, which float in a fine-grained 
          matrix of friable dolomite and calcite-silt. The diamictite above the 
          spheroid layer contains rounded to angular carbonate clasts in clay matrix 
          with some relic glass preserved. The spheroids and diamictite layers have 
          been interpreted as altered impact glass based on their smectite-rich 
          clay composition. There are significant differences in the clay mineral 
          compositions of the Maastrichtian dolomite, spheroid and diamictite units.<br>
          The spheroid clay layer is characterized by a single clay mineral phase, 
          which consists of extremely well-crystallized smectite characterized by 
          very high intensity, and a webby morphology with the major element a typical
          <b>Cheto Mg-smectite</b> (Si, Al, Mg, with minor Fe and K). This Cheto 
          type Mg-smectite indicates a single origin for the spheroid layer and 
          the <b>alteration of glass</b>.<br>
          In the diamictite above the spheroid layer, the clay composition is similar, 
          with extremely abundant smectite (90%), but contains also minor amounts 
          of palygorskite, kaolinite and illite. Smectite is slightly less well 
          crystallized. These features suggest a multiple origin for the diamictite 
          constituents, including erosion of carbonate sediments, soils and glass 
          alteration.&quot;<br>

              in the Albion Island quarry (northern Belize), immediately above the 
              eroded Maastrichtian bedrock, are older altered volcanic deposits, 
              and include a time gap to the following Chicxulub event.</font><font size="4" color="#000080"><b>
              </b></font><font color="#000080">The clay spheroids are altered volcanic 
              glass, and the dolomite spheroids are accretionary lapilli. The overlying 
              &gt;15-m-thick diamictite are falling-back material from the Chicxulub 
              event. The breccias unit containing rare altered glass, large accretionary 
              blocks, striated, and impacted cobbles. The localities in Belize are 
              unique because here is documented a volcanic activity before the Chicxulub 
              event (right).<br>
              <font size="1"><br>
              </font>In southern Belize, these deposits are completely missing. 
              Here are directly above the bedrock, with a time gap, deposits of 
              the Paleocene, which are interspersed with reworked breccias (Cayo 
              diamictite), other clasts and volcanic glasses. This is the result 
              of a widespread volcanism at that time in the entire Caribbean region.<br>
              The situation is similar in the location Beloc/Haiti. About eroded 
              Maastrichtian limestones follow on a time gap deposits of the Paleocene, 
              which are interspersed with volcanic glasses.<font size="1"><br>

              </font>The partly massive breccia packages of Guatemala and southern 
              Mexico (Actela, Trinitaria, Bochil, Guayal, Campeche drilling field) 
              again are falling-back debris from the Chicxulub event. It seems that 
              the whole region was in time of the Chicxulub event in a non-marine 
              phase. The biostratigraphically documented Paleocene sedimetation 
              follows after a time gap.<br>
