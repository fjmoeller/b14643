          <td width="70%"><font color="#000080">Andesites are the volcanic equivalent 
          of a dioritic magma with aphanitic to porphyritic texture. Andesite is 
          an often dark-colored. fine-grained rock. which have 57 to 63 % SiO2 and 
          &lt;6 % Na2O+K2O as weight (illustrated in the TAS diagram). In a general 
          sense, it is the intermediate type between basalt and granite. The mineral 
          assemblage is typically dominated by plagioclase as well pyroxene (clinopyroxene 
          and orthopyroxene) and/or amphibole (hornblende). Magnetite, zircon, apatite, 
          ilmenite, biotite, and garnet are common accessory minerals. <br>
          Texturally, most andesites are porphyritic rocks with prominent phenocrysts. 
          These phenocrysts are typically enclosed in the fine-grained groundmass.
          <br>
          Classification of andesites may be refined according to the relations 
          of amounts. The quartz-alkalifeldspar-plagioclase-foide abundances in 
          andesite are illustrated in the Streckeisen QAPF diagram.</font></td>

      Whole-rock major element compositions are similar to medium- to high-K calc-alkalic 
      andesite to dacite. Results for Y6-N17 generally agree with those published 
      elsewhere (Hildebrand et al., 1991). As expected from the variegated lithology 
      of the Y6-NI9 breccia, these subsamples exhibit some compositional variability, 
      but on average are significantly lower in SiO2 and Na2O and higher in CaO 
      than either Y6-N17 or C1-NI0.</font><br>
      <font size="2">Pyroxene phenocryst compositions in our samples from all three 
      core intervals are exclusively augite and, predictably, lie within the range 
      of augite core compositions (En40-55Wo38-40Fs7-20) in andesites. The coarser 
      grains of the C1-N10 matrix show an iron-enrichment trend, with modest, corresponding 
      increases in Na2O, TiO2, and MnO. These variations also characterize the extent 
      of core to rim zoning within individual phenocrysts, the increase of Fe occurring 
      abruptly near crystal margins. Compositions within the finer-grained melt 
      clasts in C1-N10 form a relatively tight duster with an average composition 
      of&nbsp; En49Wo42Fs9. Our analyses of augite microphenocrysts in Y6-N17 and 
      Y6-N19 yield an average (En45Wo45Fs12) consistent with those of Kring and 
      Boynton (1992), but contrast with the fassaitic compositions reported by Cediilo 
      et al. (1994).<br>
      Compared to those in C1-N10, augites in Y6-N17 and Y6-N19 are generally lower 
      in SiO 2 and molar Mg/(Mg + Fe), and higher in Na20, TiO2, and MnO. Apart 
      from slightly higher SiO2, there are no significant compositional differences 
      between augite microphenocrysts in the groundmass and those bordering undigested 
      quartz clasts.<br>
      Although the feldspar mineral assemblage as a whole shows considerable chemical 
      variability, plagioclase is the only feldspar present as a phenocryst. Consequently, 
      those early-formed plagioclase crystals that have not suffered extensive alteration 
      define a more restricted range of variation (andesine to labradorite) and 
      thus are compositionally as well as texturally distinct from feldspars in 
      the surrounding mesostasis. With decreasing An content (An59-32), coarser 
      plagioclase phenocrysts in the C1-N10 matrix show a corresponding monotonic 
      decrease in MgO, and an initial Fe-enrichment trend that attains a maximum 
      at Anso, followed by a decrease in FeO. Plagioclase phenocrysts within the 
      finer-grained melt clasts of C1- N10 tend to be more calcic, relatively constant 
      in MgO, and higher in FeO, with an Fe-enrichment maximum at An56. Analyses 
      of Y6-N17 and Y6-N19 are generally higher in K2O and FeO and lower in MgO 
      than those of C1-N10 and are consistent with the average composition of groundmass 
      plagioclase in Y6-N 17 published previously (Kring and Boynton, 1992).<br>
      The mesostasis of C1-N10 includes alkali feldspar and plagioclase ranging 
      from oligoclase to pure albite. An example of the textural relations of these 
      feldspars to a euhedral plagioclase phenocryst shows that albite forms at 
      the expense of the calcic host, which in turn is surrounded by anhedral K-feldspar 
      intergrown with quartz, epidote, minute opaque minerals, and a cryptocrystalline 
      aluminosilicate that appears to be a devitrification product of glass. Feldspar 
      compositions in the mesostasis of Y6-N17 are highly variable; however, with 
      the exception of albite, our analyses indicate that they are nonstoichiometric. 
      These anhedral, cationdeficient phases fill the interstices of the andesine 
      and augite microphenocrysts, some of which protrude into the ubiquitous drusy 
      cavities (Fig. 1B). Thermodynamic considerations together with textural relations 
      between early-formed phases and the porous mesostasis suggest to us that, 
      as in C1-N10, the albite results from secondary alteration (Schuraytz and 
      Sharpton, 1993). Similar compositional and textural relations characterize 
      feldspar variations in the Y6-N 19 mesostasis, although the variations in 
      porosity are more extreme.</font></p>

      Warren &amp; Claeys -- Geological Society of America, Special Paper 307, 1996<br>
      <br>
      We have studied seven thin sections of &quot;impact melt-derived rocks&quot; from Chicxulub: 
      one from core C1, position N9, a short distance above the C1/N10 sample of 
      Sharpton et al. (1992) and Schuraytz et al. (1994); and three each from positions 
      N17 and N19 of core Y6, the same as the original positions of samples described 
      previously by Hildebrand et al. (1991), Kring and Boynton (1992), Sharpton 
      et al. (1992), and Schuraytz et al. (1994). Our samples came from ~1,390 (C1/N9), 
      ~1,297 (Y6/N17), and ~1,378 (Y6/N19) m below sea level.<br>
      The matrix portions of all six Y6 thin sections are aphanitic and are dominated 
      by grains &lt;10&#956;m across, albeit leucocratic, texturally diverse but generally 
      much coarser grained lithic clasts are incongruously sprinkled throughout 
      (~20 vol%). The extraordinarily wide range of feldspar compositions in the 
      Y6/N19 samples &quot;tends to confirm the textural evidence for origin as a clast-rich 
      magma&quot;. Pyroxene compositions show considerable variation between matrix portions 
      of two nearby Y6/N19 samples. The Y6/N19-10 pyroxenes are remarkably rich 
      in Al2O3.<br>
      Among our samples, the coarsest matrix by far is that of C1/N9, with grains 
      mostly ~0.3 mm in maximum dimension. Texturally and mineralogically, this 
      sample strongly resembles C1/N10 (Schuraytz et al., 1994). Only six clasts 
      are discernible, all very fine grained (feldspar and pyroxene ~20&#956;m), totaling 
      ~2 vol% of the rock. A minor proportion (1%) of the matrix consists of isolated 
      uncommonly coarse (up to 1.6 mm) grains similar to those described as phenocrysts 
      (up to1 mm) in C1/N10 by Schuraytz et al. (1994). We retain this term for 
      C1/N9 grains coarser than twice the prevalent 0.3 mm size, including three 
      of the most diopside-rich pyroxenes analyzed. <br>
      C1/N9 and C1/N10 are the coarsest Chicxulub &quot;impact&quot; melt products yet sampled. 
      Most other &quot;impact&quot; melt-like rocks (from elsewhere in the C1 and Y6 cores 
      and from the S1 core) are described as “glass” or “microcrystalline” (Hildebrand 
      et al., 1991; Quezada Muñeton et al., 1992; Kring and Boynton, 1992) or as 
      “fine- to medium-grained coherent crystalline” (Sharpton et al., 1992). Sharpton 
      et al. (1992) described Y6/N19 as having a “medium- to coarse-grained melt 
      rock matrix,” but a more detailed recent description by three of the same 
      authors (Schuraytz et al., 1994) indicates that their sample from Y6/N19, 
      like the two we studied, consists mainly of an aphanitic matrix with grains 
      ~10 &#956;m across. <br>
      The finer grain size of the Chicxulub samples is probably not a consequence 
      of systematically smaller dimensions of individual Chicxulub “meltbodies,” 
      because according to Lopez Ramos (1975) the Chicxulub cores C1, S1, and Y6 
      all contain layers of pure&nbsp; extrusive andesite&nbsp; over 200 m thick. 
      The Y6/N17 samples came from near the middle of a 60-m-thick continuous&nbsp; 
      extrusive andesite&nbsp; layer, and the Y6/N19 samples came from ~12 m below 
      the top of a continuous layer ~220 m thick (Meyerhoff et al., 1994).

      Yucatan melt rock samples, from the well Chicxulub-1 ( C1) and from the well 
      Yucatan 6 (Y6), were analyzed and seem to show significant differences.<br>
      The melt rocks in C1 (C1-N9: 1390 mbsl; C1- N10: 1393 mbsl) have a very coarse-grained, 
      aphanitic matrix containing approximately 5 vol% quartz (10 &#956;m), 25 vol% K-feldspar 
      (50 &#956;m), 64 vol% plagioclase (100 &#956;m), 5 vol% augitic pyroxene (100 &#956;m in 
      scale) and 1 vol% opaques minerals (&lt; 10 &#956;m, ilmenite, pyrite). No clasts 
      were found.<br>
      In contrast to C1, the melt rock in well Y6 (Y6-N17: 1295.5- 1299 mbsl; Y6-N19: 
      1377-1379.5 mbsl) is more clast rich. Quartz, feldspar, anhydrite and carbonate 
      clasts, range in size between 0.4 and 2 mm. All clasts except anhydrite and 
      carbonate, are surrounded by a corona of augitic pyroxenes and K-feldspars. 
      The clasts are usually subrounded, many are broken and their fractures are 
      filled with matrix. Here to, many basement clasts are partly digested by the 
      matrix. Vermicular anhydrite is also present in vein and cavities, suggesting 
      pore filling (either from a melt or vapor phase) during the melt´s major cooling 
      phase. The melt rock in well Y6 is more altered than its C1 counterpart and 
      new mineral parageneses such as zeolites (stilbite, laumontite) and secondary 
      calcite have often formed in cracks and holes.<br>
      The Y6 fine grained hypocrystalline matrix is composed of quartz (8 vol%), 
      alkali feldspar: (13 vol%), plagioclase (66 vol%), augitic pyroxene (12 vol%) 
      and minor constituents such as magnetite, ilmenite, sphene, zircon etc. (1 
      vol%). The matrix grain size is always below 10 &#956;m, much finer than in C1 
      melt rock. Locally, the matrix even appears glassy or cryptocrystalline. The 
      feldspar in the matrix consists of remnants of K-rich feldspar, mantled by 
      a more Ca-rich feldspar phase, indicating a chemical change of the melt to 
      a more Ca-rich composition. The abundance of Ca-rich fluids is also corroborated 
      by the strongly augitic composition of the pyroxenes.</span></p>
