            <font size="2">&quot;The uppermost peak ring is composed of ~130 m of breccia, 
            with impact melt fragments that overlie clastpoor impact melt rock.We 
            encountered felsic basement rocks between 748 and 1334.7 mbsf that were 
            intruded by preimpact mafic and felsic igneous dikes as well as impact-generated 
            dikes.<br/>
            We recovered one particularly thick impact breccia and impact melt rock 
            sequence between 1250 and 1316 mbsf. The entire section of felsic basement 
            exhibits impact-induced deformation on multiple scales. There aremany 
            fractures, foliated shear zones, and cataclasites, as well as signs 
            of localized hydrothermal alteration. The felsic basement is predominantly 
            a coarse-grained, roughly equigranular granitic rock that is locally 
            aplitic or pegmatitic and, in a few cases, syenitic.<br/>
            The basement rocks in the peak ring differ from basement in nearby drill 
            holes encountered immediately below the Mesozoic sedimentary rocks, 
            suggesting a source of origin that was deeper than 3 km <b>
            <font color="#FF0000">(???)</font>.</b><br/>
            Evidence of shock metamorphism is pervasive throughout the entire basement, 
            with quartz crystals displaying up to four sets of decorated planar 
            deformation features. We observed <u>shatter cone fragments in pre-impact 
            dikes</u> between 1129 and 1162 mbsf, as well as within the breccia. 
            Jointly, the observed shock metamorphic features suggest that the peak 
            ring rocks were subjected to shock pressures of ~10 to 35 GPa
            <font color="#FF0000">(?)</font> . No clear systematic variation in 
            shock metamorphism was observed with depth. Impact-melt, which is formed 
            at shock pressures of &gt;60 GPa <font color="#FF0000">(?)</font>, is also 
            a component of the peak ring.<br/>
            The formation of the Chicxulub peak ring from felsic basement confirms 
            that crustal rocks lie directly above Mesozoic sedimentary rocks, which 
            is consistent with the dynamic collapse model of peak ring formation
            <font color="#FF0000">(???)</font>. <br/>
            The drilling data confirm that the peak ring rocks have low densities 
            and seismic velocities, as suggested by geophysical models. The density 
            of the felsic basement varies between 2.10 and 2.55 g cm&#8722;3, with a mean 
            of 2.41 g cm&#8722;3, and P wave velocities vary between 3.5 and 4.5 km s&#8722;1, 
            with a mean of 4.1 km s&#8722;1. These values are unusually low for felsic 
            basement, which typically has densities of &gt;2.6 g cm&#8722;3
            <font color="#FF0000">(correct is: 2.5 to 2.7)</font> and seismic velocities 
            of &gt;5.5 km s&#8722;1 <font color="#FF0000">(correct is: 4.0 to 6.0)</font>.&quot;<br>
            It is claimed that the condition of the drilled felsic basement rocks 
            provide the evidence for the existent of a &quot;peak ring&quot; in the Chicxulub 
            crater. These parts of this crystalline basement were shifted several 
            kilometers towards the surface during impact and lie directly above 
            Mesozoic sedimentary rocks. These rocks are cross-cut by dikes and shear 
            zones and have an unusually (?) low density and seismic velocity. Analysis 
            shows that impact generated vertical fluxes and increased porosity.<b><br/>

                      &quot;Hole M0077A was drilled through a long succession of mainly 
                      felsic basement rocks of granitoid composition from 747.02 
                      mbsf (Section 95R-3, 117 cm) to the bottom of the hole.<br>
                      These rocks are petrographically characterized as coarse-grained 
                      granite to syenite hosting aplite and pegmatite dikes. Moreover, 
                      granitoid rocks are intruded by three types of subvolcanic 
                      dikes or dike swarms that are macroscopically classified as 
                      felsite, dacite, and diabase/dolerite. An approximately 100 
                      m thick unit of&nbsp; suevite and impact melt rock (edited: 
                      melt rock and clast bearing melt rock) occurs at 1215–1316 
                      mbsf.<br>
                      <b>Granitoids</b><br>
                      The dominant basement lithology is macroscopically classified 
                      as a granitoid. Overall, the rock is coarse grained and consists 
                      of red to pink alkali-feldspar, white to light yellowish plagioclase, 
                      and gray to white quartz, with some biotite and, locally, 
                      accessory minerals.<br>
                      Alteration of granitoids is mostly observed near contact zones 
                      with faults,&nbsp; melt rock, breccias, and intrusive dikes. 
                      Granitoids here display color variations that could be caused 
                      by thermal or shock alteration or a combination of both. Feldspars 
                      often show discoloration to green or variable shades of yellow, 
                      orange, and red, whereas quartz may turn milk-white or rarely 
                      pale red. Mafic minerals locally appear midgray instead of 
                      black.</font></p>

                      Aplite and pegmatite dikes were commonly observed within the

                      range in thickness from ~10 to 80 cm. Aplite is characterized 
                      by fine-grained zones of diffusely distributed feldspar minerals 
                      andranges from orange to dark pink. Apart from alkali-feldspar,

                      biotite. Contact boundaries between the dikes and the host 
                      granitic rock are commonly sharp and do not show metamorphism 
                      or alteration zones.<br>
                      <b>Dacite</b><br>
                      Three grayish brown dikes were found within the granitoid 
                      rocks in Sections 164R-3, 238R-1, 238R-2, and 246R-3 through 
                      247R-2 and were macroscopically described as dacites. These 
                      dacite dikes have a porphyritic texture with euhedral plagioclase 
                      phenocrysts as large as 3.5 cm, alkali-feldspar phenocrysts 
                      as large as 2 cm, and minor quartz and biotite. Alkali-feldspar 
                      locally displays reaction rims and may therefore be clasts 
                      derived from the granitoid country rock. The groundmass is 
                      medium-grained with plagioclase, alkali-feldspar, and amphibole. 
                      Dike thicknesses are between 0.6 and 2.7 m.<br>
                      <b>Felsite</b><br>
                      Three very fine grained, homogeneous, midbrown to gray dikes 
                      within the granitoid rocks in Sections 234R-2 through 235R-2, 
                      236R-3 through 237R-1, and 238R-3 through 239R-2 were macroscopically 
                      described as felsites. Larger phenocrysts seen in the dacite 
                      are lacking here. Felsite dike thicknesses range from 1.5 
                      to 2.5 m. Xenoliths occur and sometimes include the local 
                      granitic host rock but otherwise are deep-sourced gneiss or 
                      amphibolite that range in size from submillimeter to ~5 cm. 
                      Felsite has local white- or black-filled veins and rare quartz-filled 
                      vugs as large as 3 cm.</font></p>

                      Several mafic dikes were observed in the upper portion of 
                      the granitoids and were macroscopically described as diabase/dolerite. 
                      They have two textures; the more common one is porphyritic, 
                      composed of a dark gray to black aphanitic groundmass containing 
                      characteristic ~1–10 mm needle-shaped white-green, partially 
                      altered plagioclase phenocrysts and 1 mm long mafic phenocrysts. 
                      The other consists of a dark gray to black aphanitic groundmass 
                      without plagioclase phenocrysts. The groundmass is composed 
                      of mafic and felsic mineral constituents and iron sulfide 
                      mineral phases. Rarely, there are granitic fragments within

                      appear partially digested. Dike thicknesses range from a few

                  rock</b></font>)<br>
                  An approximately 100 m thick unit of <i>suevite and impact melt 
                  rock</i> occurs from 1215 to 1316 mbsf (Cores 265R–298R), with 
                  suevite as the dominant lithology. In Cores 277R–298R, <i>suevite 
                  and impact melt rock</i> form a nearly continuous, 58 m thick 
                  interval, with only a few decimeter- to meter-scale occurrences 
                  of granite, some of which may be <i>suevite </i>within the impact 
                  melt rock.<br>
                  Flow banding occurs in both. The clasts entrained in the units 
                  have angular to rounded shapes and consist of melt rock, granitic 
                  rock (including aplite), granodiorite, felsite, diabase/dolerite, 
                  another unidentified mafic lithology, gneiss, mylonite, schist, 
                  and quartzite. These rocks do not have visible carbonate clasts 
                  or clasts of other sedimentary rocks. The largest clast logged 
                  was 100 cm (a gneiss in Section 281R-2). Some clasts are mantled 
                  by <i>impact melt rock</i>. Other clasts are partially resorbed 
                  or digested within the melt rock.<br>
                  The <i>impact melt rock and suevite </i>are locally altered. White 
                  and green veins were observed, and diffuse green mineralization 
                  is common. Dissolution vugs occur in both intervals and are in 
                  some cases partially filled with a green mineral. Red and yellow 
                  mineralization is also present but less frequent than green mineralization.&quot;<br>

                  Compared to the granitoids, the pre-impact dike lithologies (felsite,

                  than the granitic rocks, whereas MgO, FeO, CaO, MnO, and TiO2 
                  are typically significantly enriched. A dacite sampled at 1160.9 
                  mbsf exhibits a moderate enrichment in TiO2 and a moderate depletion

                  &quot;Upper Peak Ring interval lithologies are divided into Units 2 
                  and 3. Unit 2 is polymict breccia with impact melt rock fragments 
                  and is thus suevite. Unit 3 is impact melt rock with occasional 
                  (&lt;25%) clasts. Units 2 and 3 are divided into Subunits 2A–2C, 
                  3A, and 3B based on sedimentary features and matrix or groundmass 
                  characteristics.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Unit 2</b><br>
                  The upper surface of Unit 2 in the lithologic sequence is defined 
                  by the sharp stylolitized contact at the top of the cross-bedded 
                  suevite in Section 40R-1, 109.4 cm (617.33 mbsf). Unit 2 is an 
                  approximately 104 m thick suevite (interval 40R-1, 109.4 cm, to 
                  87R-2, 90 cm; 617.33–721.62 mbsf) and is predominantly composed 
                  of various types of green to black impact melt rock clasts, as 
                  well as to a lesser degree lithic fragments, including Mesozoic 
                  sedimentary rocks and crystalline basement rocks. The maximum 
                  clast size, defined here as the long axis length of the largest 
                  clast in each section, varies from 0.2 cm to more than 25 cm. 
                  Overall, the unit has a fining-upward trend, although upward coarsening 
                  or grain size oscillations in maximum clast size are locally observable, 
                  especially in the upper part of Subunit 2A.</font></p>

                  <p dir="ltr"><font size="2"><b>Unit 3</b><br>
                  The second principal lithology of the Upper Peak Ring interval 
                  consists of a ~25 m thick succession of impact melt rocks. It 
                  is dominantly clast-poor impact melt rock, but clast-rich intervals 
                  occur locally. <br>
                  <b>Subunit 3A</b><br>
                  Subunit 3A is ~16 m thick (interval 87R-2, 90 cm, to 92R-3, 17 
                  cm; 721.62–737.56 mbsf) and is characterized by a mixture of dark 
                  green and black clast-poor impact melt rocks. The first occurrence 
                  of the dark green melt rock marks the top of the subunit. The 
                  green melt rock often forms a matrix with angular fragments of 
                  black melt rock. These black melt rock fragments commonly entrain 
                  various mineral fragments and &lt;1 mm to ~1 cm lithic fragments 
                  and also can contain vesicles and flow lines. The green melt rock 
                  reacts to HCl and thus may be altered through hydrothermal processes. 
                  The green melt rock was also found to be intimately intermixed 
                  with black melt rock, forming multiple millimeter to centimeter 
                  thin schlieren of green material within the black melt rock.<br>
                  Black impact melt rock also occurs in larger regions up to 0.5 
                  m in size. These regions include centimeter- to decimeter-sized 
                  clasts of target material. The smaller clasts are partially resorbed 
                  and in some cases heavily shocked, making lithologic identification 
                  difficult. Larger clasts in the impact melt rock are composed 
                  of metamorphic and igneous target lithologies, including decimeter-sized 
                  clasts of granodiorite (Sample 91R-1, 44–68 cm) and gneiss (Sample 
                  91R-1, 94–110 cm) and rare clasts of red sandstone (e.g., Sample 
                  90R-3, 8–15 cm).<br>
                  One thin section was available for this subunit (Sample 89R-3, 
                  39–43 cm). The impact melt rock in this sample is variably altered, 
                  with some parts consisting of microcrystalline melt rock with 
                  tiny phenocryst laths in an aphanitic groundmass (with partly 
                  digested clasts and blebs of opaque minerals), green domains consisting 
                  of smectite (likely a secondary alteration product from a formerly 
                  glassy melt), zeolite, silica, and chloritoid/chlorite. Up to 
                  ~0.5 cm angular to subrounded clasts in the melt rock are variably 
                  assimilated, some with reaction coronas. A few silica clasts with 
                  ballen quartz occur, and one clast of quartz with decorated planar 
                  deformation features was noted. <br>
                  <b>Subunit 3B</b><br>
                  Subunit 3B occurs below the green schlieren-bearing black impact 
                  melt rock and is a ~9 m thick, black, coherent, clast-poor impact 
                  melt rock (interval 92R-3, 17 cm, to 95R-3, 117 cm; 737.56–747.02 
                  mbsf). The contact occurs at the lowest occurrence of green schlieren. 
                  Although the green schlieren are absent, the black melt rock still 
                  contains observable flow banding and vesicles. It also entrains 
                  a variety of mineral and lithic clasts. In some parts, the clasts 
                  are evenly distributed. Other areas contain clusters and subtle 
                  alignments of clasts. As in Subunit 3A, clasts are composed of 
                  metamorphic and igneous target lithologies, but Subunit 3B lacks 
                  visible clasts of sedimentary lithologies. Granitoid clasts dominate 
                  and increase in abundance toward the base of the subunit, reaching 
                  42 cm in size before the base. Subunit 3B contains clasts of previously 
                  solidified impact melt rock that seem to have separated, and the 
                  gaps are filled with melt rock. The lower surface of this subunit 
                  is the top of the shocked granitoid target in Section 95R-3 at 
                  747.02 mbsf.<br>
                  One thin section was available for this subunit (Sample 93R-3), 
                  revealing that this impact melt rock is composed of a fine-grained 
                  matrix made of tiny plagioclase laths and opaque minerals (magnetite) 
                  in a melt (now altered to clay minerals). Mineral clasts including 
                  quartz,<font color="#FF0000"> alkali-feldspar, and plagioclase</font> 
                  occur, as well as partially assimilated mineral and rock (mainly 
                  granitoids) clasts and some melt rock fragments. Quartz grains 
                  display planar deformation features and are in some cases toasted. 
                  Plagioclase grains with possible planar deformation features were 
                  also noted.&quot;</font></p>

                  The clay fraction is dominated by smectite (average = 20% of saponite) 
                  and traces of mica (phlogopite and glauconite), chlorite (clinochlore), 
                  vermiculite, clinoptilolite, and serpentine (lizardite and antigorite). 
                  Accessory minerals are again highly variable, including feldspar 
                  (<font color="#FF0000">sanidine, orthoclase, bassanite, and nepheline</font>), 
                  zeolite (microcline and andesine), silicates (talc, forsterite, 
                  sodalite, diopside, and ferrosilite), evaporite (gypsum), and 
                  oxides (corundum and magnetite). Of particular note is the occurrence 
                  of coesite, a high-pressure polymorph of quartz, in Core 87R at 
                  719.99 mbsf, near the top of Unit 3.&quot;<br>

                      (from 505.7 to 617.3 mbsf), an upper (peak ring) section of 
                      &quot;suevite&quot; and melt rocks (from 617.3 to 747.0 mbsf), and a 
                      lower (peak ring) section mainly consisting of granitoid rocks 
                      (with aplite and pegmatite dikes) intruded by different types 
                      of subvolcanic dikes, and intercalations of millimeter to 
                      decameter thick &quot;suevite&quot; and&nbsp; melt rock units (from 
                      747.0 to 1334.7 mbsf).<br/>
                      The upper (peak ring) section consists of 104 m of&nbsp; &quot;suevite&quot;&nbsp; 
                      (polymict lithic breccia with mm to over 25 cm in size melt 
                      clasts and lithic mineral and rock fragments) on top of ~25 
                      m&nbsp; melt rock (dominantly clast-poor but with clast-rich 
                      intervals). The matrix of the &quot;suevite&quot; is calcitic (ranging 
                      from micritic to sparitic). Clasts include a variety of more 
                      or less shocked mineral and rock fragments (sedimentary [including 
                      isolated fossils], metamorphic, and igneous lithologies, with 
                      carbonate and granitoid being the most abundant rock types) 
                      and melt fragments withaltered (green to brown in color in 
                      plane-polarized-light; clay minerals) glassy to microcrystalline 
                      textures. Many of the melt fragments have flow textures and 
                      are occasionally vesicular. They often contain relic mineral 
                      clasts (dominated by feldspars and quartz) and shocked lithic 
                      rock fragments, or are, themselves, coated with an additional 
                      layer of melt. Quartz grains show planar fractures (PFs) and/or 
                      (decorated) planar deformation features (PDFs), with up to 
                      3 sets. A few toasted quartz grains were noted. Silica glass, 
                      generally recrystallized, with a chert-like appearance (and 
                      with ballen silica also occur. Other minerals also exhibit 
                      shock features, especially plagioclase and alkali-feldspar 
                      (with PFs and PDFs). Possible coesite (??) was observed in 
                      a large silica-rich melt fragment. The melt rock from the 
                      lower part of the upper (peak ring) section is green to black 
                      in color, with flow banding, and in some cases vesicular. 
                      The green and black melts are locally intermixed, forming 
                      schlieren of green material (altered melt?) in a black-colored 
                      melt. A large variety of clasts are present (as in &quot;suevite&quot;, 
                      with the exception of sedimentary rock clasts that were not 
                      found), in some cases so heavily shocked and/or hydrothermally 
                      altered that it was difficult to identify them. Shock features 
                      similar to those in &quot;suevite&quot; were observed in the melt rocks, 
                      such as PFs and PDFs in quartz, toasted quartz, and a variety 
                      of shock features in other minerals.<br/>
                      The lower (peak ring) section consists mainly of pervasively 
                      deformed granitoid basement rocks (granite to syenite), overall 
                      coarse-grained, with locally cm to dm thick aplitic and pegmatitic 
                      sections. All main rock-forming minerals, i.e., alkali-feldspar, 
                      plagioclase, quartz, and biotite, show signs of shock deformation. 
                      In the case of quartz, locally PFs were even visible as a 
                      result of preferential hydrothermal alteration. Almost all 
                      quartz grains are shocked, with PFs, feather features (FFs), 
                      and/or (decorated) PDFs ; up to 4 sets of PDFs are seen. Kinkbanding 
                      was also observed for some quartz grains. Similar shock features 
                      were observed in alkali-feldspar and plagioclase. Biotites 
                      and chlorites are often kinked. Based on qualitative evaluation 
                      of the thin sections no noticeable shock attenuation with 
                      depth was observed. Preliminary quantitative results seem 
                      to indicate little or no shock attenuation with depth.<br/>

                      mbsf, beginning with a 104-m-thick polymict, melt-bearing 
                      breccia (<font color="#FF0000">Unit 2</font>) with a calcitic 
                      matrix that may represent a plume of carbonate ash. The most 
                      abundant clasts in the breccia are melt fragments. That unit 
                      has been sub-divided (2A, 2B, 2C) based on sedimentary and 
                      matrix features. A melt rock, <font color="#FF0000">Unit 3</font>, 
                      extends ~26 m to a depth of 747 mbsf. It is dominantly a clast-poor 
                      melt rock, but clast-rich intervals occur at ~722, ~732-734, 
                      and ~744 mbsf. It has been subdivided to reflect a change 
                      from green schlieren-bearing black melt (3A) to a basal ~9.5 
                      m-thick coherent black melt unit (3B). Those units cover granite 
                      and related basement lithologies. Thin, &lt;1 m-thick melt horizons 
                      were logged within the granite. A thicker (~4 m) series of 
                      melt and melt-bearing breccia horizons were logged at ~1000 
                      mbsf and ~58 m of melt and melt-bearing breccias dominate 
                      the lower 100 m of core. The total thickness of the basement 
                      interval sampled by the borehole is 588 m.<br/>
                      <br/>
                      <b>Clast Content</b>: There is a diverse array of sedimentary, 
                      metamorphic, and igneous clasts within those units. Sedimentary 
                      lithologies are carbonate, chert that in many cases is visibly 
                      associated with and derived from carbonate, shale, sandstone, 
                      and red silt-stone. Metamorphic lithologies are gneiss, mylonite, 
                      schist, amphibolite, and quartzite. Marble was also logged, 
                      but thin-section studies are needed to determine if it is 
                      a target unit or shock-modified carbonate. Igneous lithologies 
                      include granite, granodiorite, diorite, dacite, felsite, and 
                      mafic clasts that were variously logged as gabbro, diabase, 
                      and dolerite. Carbonate and granite are the most abundant 
                      lithologies.<br/>
                      Sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous lithologies are found 
                      in the uppermost units, but carbonate was not logged in the 
                      bottom eight cores (from ~722 to ~747 mbsf) of the Unit 3 
                      melt rock, and granite dominates the clast assemblage at the 
                      base of that interval. Thin melt horizons within the granite 
                      only have clasts of (locally derived) granite. However, the 
                      horizon at ~1000 mbsf contains clasts of melt, granite, granodiorite, 
                      dolerite, and gneiss. The basal interval of melt and melt-bearing 
                      breccias also has a diverse array of metamorphic and igneous 
                      clasts, but no sedimentary clasts.<br/>
                      <br/>
                      <b>Discussion:</b> For the melt-bearing horizons within the 
                      granite, we consider four hypotheses. (1) The &quot;impact&quot; melts 
                      in the granite may have been injected into the walls of the 
                      transient crater and transported with the bounding granite 
                      during uplift and collapse into a peak ring. This seems unlikely, 
                      however, because the granite is heavily sheared while the 
                      impact melt rocks and melt-bearing breccias are not. The melts 
                      were introduced after most (albeit not all) of the deformation 
                      of the peak ring had occurred. <br/>
                      The &quot;impact&quot; melts in the granite may have instead been (2) 
                      produced by melting along shear planes and faults in the basement. 
                      That is a likely source of the thin, &lt;1 m melt horizons, which 
                      only contain clasts of granite. However, there is a wide variety 
                      of clasts in the thicker melt-bearing units at ~1000 mbsf 
                      and at the base of the borehole that would require transport 
                      of multiple lithologies (granodiorite, gneiss, dolerite) an 
                      unknown distance along an intrusive conduit and emplacement 
                      in granite.<br/>
                      We cannot discount, however, (3) the infusion of melt from 
                      adjacent melt pools along open fractures in the peak ring. 
                      The melts at the base of the borehole lie at a greater depth 
                      than &quot;impact&quot; melt in the adjacent crater trough, although 
                      that source may require transport through fractures over a 
                      distanceof at least 2 km, without quenching, while mixing 
                      with clasts from multiple peak-ring lithologies. <b><br/>
                      </b><i>An alternative </i>(<u>ludicrously</u>)<i> hypothesis 
                      (4) is prompted by the lack of sedimentary clasts in the deeper 
                      &quot;impact&quot; melts. If the dynamic collapse and Displaced Structure 
                      Uplift models are correct, then as the peak ring collapsed 
                      and deformed outward, it may have overrun and flowed over 
                      surficial melt-bearing components before the fallback breccia 
                      with its sedimentary clast components landed. The repetition 
                      of &quot;impact&quot; melts within the granitic sequence implies there 
                      was internal shearing within the granite as it displaced outward, 
                      allowing it to cover breccias at least twice.&quot; <br/>

                      The 50 samples from the 130 m thick section of &quot;suevite&quot; and 
                      (impact) melt rocks between 618.22&#8210;744.07 mbsf show pronounced 
                      vertical variation in their major and minor element concentrations. 
                      Based on these chemical variations, the upper (peak ring) 
                      section can be subdivded into an upper sorted &quot;suevite&quot; section 
                      from 617.34&#8210;684 mbsf that is grossly chemically homogenous. 
                      A lower sorted &quot;suevite&quot;section from 687&#8210;718 mbsf shows more 
                      chemical variation compared to the subsection above, while 
                      average concentrations are grossly similar.<br/>
                      The lowermost section between 720&#8210;744 mbsf is dominated by<font color="#FF0000">&nbsp; 
                      melt rocks </font>and is chemically distinct with higher concentrations

                      and notably, oxide totals that are typically 20 wt% higher

                      Lower Peak Ring:<br/>
                      We analyzed 194 samples from the 586 m thick section of
                      <font color="#FF0000">granite, subvolcanic dikes, &quot;suevite&quot; 
                      and melt rocks</font> between 747.89&#8210;1332.75 mbsf. The granite 
                      lithologies in this section are remarkably similar in composition, 
                      suggesting compositions of granites and syenites in the TAS 
                      diagram and metasedimentary protoliths. Subtile differences 
                      are present, though, for example Na2O concentrations from 
                      748.89&#8210;948.39 mbsf are lower than in the section between 948.39 
                      and 1332.75 m. Very low incompatible trace element compositions 
                      suggest a volcanic arc setting for the emplacement of these 
                      granites, which is also supported by their magnesian character.<br/>
                      Compared to the granitic rocks, the most common intrusive 
                      rock, a dark, aphanitic, subvolcanic lithology, has much lower 
                      SiO2 and K2O contents, while MgO, FeO, CaO, MnO, TiO2 are 
                      significantly enriched. A less common, brown, fine-grained 
                      subvolcanic lithology that exhibits shatter cones displays 
                      a chemical affinity to the dark subvolcanic dike lithology 
                      in that it shows similar depletion and enrichment trends for 
                      the major, minor and trace element concentrations compared 
                      to their granite host rocks. In the <font color="#FF0000">

                      and basanite.</font><br/>
                      Intercalcations of &quot;suevite&quot; and melt rocks show variable 
                      compositions but tend to be relatively depleted in K2O and 
                      enriched in TiO2, CaO, FeO, MgO, and MnO compared to the granitic
