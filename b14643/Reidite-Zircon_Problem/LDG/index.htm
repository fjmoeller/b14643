      <p align="left">&quot;The Libyan Desert Glass contains many zircon grains. While 
      most reacted to zirconia due to the heat, about 10% preserve evidence of former 
      reidite. But the thing is, reidite is no longer present.<br>
      It was examined zircon grains from seven samples and the critical crystal 
      orientation evidence of former reidite was present in each sample.....The 
      reidite fingerprint points to a meteor impact as the only option.&quot;</p>
      <p align="left">&quot;Multiple zircon grains were found in each sample of LDG analyzed, 
      and a total of 101 grains were documented. The majority of grains (65%) fully 
      dissociated to zirconia (now baddeleyite) and are no longer zircon. The second-largest 
      population of grains (24%) contain ubiquitous zirconia inclusions, and are 
      interpreted to have fully dissociated to zirconia, and then partially or fully 
      back-reacted with silica melt to form a new generation of zircon; the zirconia 
      inclusions are preserved because they were isolated from further reaction 
      with silica melt by newly formed zircon. As the aforementioned grains do not 
      record information about their predissociation history, they are not discussed 
      further; representative BSE images of such grains are shown in the Data Repository. 
      Only 11 of the 101 zircon grains (11%) showed no evidence of dissociation 
      to zirconia, or in a few cases, only the margins of grains had dissociated.
      <u>The 11 grains are composed of micrometer-sized neoblasts, and are the focus 
      of this study</u>. Orientation analysis by EBSD was done on eight of the 11 
      granular grains (three were too small or inaccessible). In five of the grains, 
      neoblast orientations are broadly dispersed, with minor variations, and they 
      do not form discrete orientation clusters. In contrast, neoblasts in the other 
      three grains occur in multiple orientation clusters with systematic relations. 
      An example of a grain with systematic orientation clusters is shown in Figure 
      2. The grain has a granular zircon core consisting of 0.5–1.0 µm neoblasts, 
      and a few zirconia inclusions located along the margin and/or along partings, 
      both adjacent to glass (i.e., former melt) (Fig. 2A). The core is surrounded 
      by a semi-detached rim that consists of ~0.5 µm zirconia grains (baddeleyite) 
      that are enveloped by thin neoblastic overgrowths of zircon (Fig. 2A, inset). 
      Orientation mapping reveals that the entirety of the grain consists of many 
      distinct orientation clusters (Fig. 2B). However, zircon neoblasts comprising 
      the granular core consist of only three mutually orthogonal orientation clusters 
      that are highly systematic; each orientation cluster can be related to another 
      cluster by 90°/&lt;110&gt; (Fig. 2C). High-angle (75°–95°) misorientation axes defined 
      by adjacent neoblasts in the core are also highly systematic (Fig. 2D), and 
      coincide with each of the three &lt;110&gt; clusters (Fig. 2C). In contrast, zircon 
      in the rim consists of &gt;15 orientation clusters, most of which do not preserve 
      a systematic relation to each other or to neoblast clusters in the granular 
      core.&quot;</p>

      of the LDG&#39;s volcanic origin. Due to the occurrence of tridymite and cristobalite 
      in the LDG, a last melting temperature of 1700 ° C with already low pressure 
      load is proven. The presence of fingerprints of a former reidite in the LDG 
      is not a puzzling.</font></b></p>
