      <p align="left"><font size="4">&quot;Pantasma is a 14.5 km diameter circular structure 
      located in Oligocene felsic volcanic rocks in Nicaragua. Observations include 
      outward&#8208;dipping volcanic flows, the presence of former melt&#8208;bearing polymict 
      breccia, melt glass (with lechatelierite and coesite), and also a possible 
      ejecta layer containing Paleozoic rocks which originated from hundreds of 
      meters below the surface.<br>
      The Pantasma structure has been proposed to have an impact origin based on 
      the occurrence of <b>decomposed zircon in melt glass</b> found in the Pantasma 
      River within the structure.<br>
      Granular zircon grains in melt glass from the Pantasma structure consist of 
      ~1 &#956;m-sized neoblasts in multiple domains that are systematically oriented 
      such that all are systematically oriented such that all (001) are orthogonal, 
      and coincide with a {110} direction from another domain. The neoblast orientations 
      are uniquely produced by transformation of zircon to the high-pressure polymorph
      <b>reidite</b> and its subsequent reversion to neoblastic zircon under high-temperature 
      conditions (&gt;1673°C), as evidenced by their occurrence with ZrO2.<br>
      The Pantasma zircon is a 10 x 15 &#956;m grain with a granular texture consisting 
      of ~1 &#956;m-sized neoblasts embedded in glass. The zircon contains discrete irregular 
      partings filled by glass. Inclusions of ZrO2 in zircon neoblasts occur throughout 
      the grain, although none indexed as zirconia polymorphs during electron backscatter 
      diffraction (EBSD) analysis. Six distinct neoblast orientation clusters are 
      present.&quot;</font></p>

          Former reidite in granular neoblastic (FRIGN) zircon in Pantasma (Nicaragua)

          with ZrO 2 inclusions. B: Inverse pole figure map (IPFx) showing neoblast 
          orientations. Former reidite is indicated by 90°/&lt;110&gt; boundaries. C: 
          Pole figures showing data from B that reveal six domains (labeled) that 
          each shown minimal dispersion. The 90° misorientations for {110} pole 
          clusters among orientations 1,2 and 4,5 are shown; each contains a {110} 
          orientation that coincides with a (001) pole cluster. D: Plot showing 
          high-angle (85° to 95°) misorientation axes; clusters coincide with poles 
          for {110}. Stereonets are equal-area, lower-hemisphere projections in 
          sample x-y-z reference frame.<br>

      <font color="#000080">My Conclusion:<br>
      Apart of whether the melt glass with the recrystallized zircon in it, found 
      in the Pantasma River, is actually related to the structure of the same name, 
      the proposed former Reidites in the glassy melt are not the result of an impact. 
      They come directly from basement-rocks and are volcanically re-crystallized 
      to zircon.</font></b></p>
