<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#000080">In August 2018, 
the company disclosed that it was planning a family of air-launch vehicles that 
would use the company’s giant airplane. The company said it was developing its own 
Medium Launch Vehicle (MLV) capable of placing up to 3,400 kilograms into low Earth 
orbit.<br>
<br>
Stratolaunch revealed new details Sept. 27 (2018) about a rocket engine it is developing 
for use on future launch vehicles that will fly from a giant aircraft approaching 
its first flight.<br>
The </font><font color="#FF0000">PGA engine</font><font color="#000080"> — its name 
taken from the initials of Stratolaunch’s founder Paul G. Allen — will use liquid 
oxygen and liquid hydrogen propellants with fuel-rich staged combustion and a thrust 
of 200,000 pounds-force (</font><font color="#FF0000">890 kN</font><font color="#000080">).<br>
Stratolaunch is currently working on the preburner for the PGA engine, the smaller 
of two combustion chambers in a staged combustion engine. In a fact sheet, Stratolaunch 
said it plans to perform a “full-scale” test of the preburner by the end of this 
year at NASA’s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi.<br>
While this announcement has provided the most details to date on the company’s engine 
development plans, there’s been evidence for some time that the company planned 
to embark on developing its own engines. In 2017 the company hired a former SpaceX 
executive, Jeff Thornburg, as its vice president of propulsion. It also signed a 
Space Act Agreement last September to perform engine testing at Stennis.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2">Stratolaunch Systems developing 
a commercial air launch space access system. An enormous composite wing and fuselage 
sections of the 385-ft span carrier aircraft which will carry the Orbital ATK-built 
multi-stage booster to launch altitude. Provisional details of the booster itself 
have also been revealed by Orbital. Measuring around 128 ft long, the payload will 
be encased in a 16.4 ft diameter fairing. Gross lift off (or drop) weight is expected 
to be over 465,000 lb, with the air launch vehicle (Pegasus-II) able to deliver 
13,500 lb to LEO, or 9,900 lb to a highly inclined (HIO) orbit, or 4,500 lb to GTO.
<br>
The Stratolaunch carrier aircraft will be able to take-off from airfields with a 
runway at least 12,100 ft in length and will be able to travel up to 1,200 nautical 
miles before releasing the Pegasus-II at an altitude of 30,000 ft. The system will 
be the largest aircraft ever built in terms of wingspan; with the first test flight 
of the carrier aircraft expected in 2015 from Scaled Composites&#39; facilities in Mojave, 
California. Flight testing of the 6-engined carrier aircraft is expected to begin 
in 2016 with first launch of the ALV in 2018.<br>
The first two stages of the Pegasus-II will have the same outside diameter as the 
Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster, but will be constructed using much lighter carbon-composite 
cases and contain a more energetic propellant mix. To provide guidance while in 
the atmosphere, the first stage will be equipped with two wings and a V-tail, both 
with control surfaces. Additionally, both the first and second stage motors will 
use a thrust vector control (TVC) system for attitude control in the thin upper 
atmosphere. <br>
The third stage was originally intended to be a restartable cryogenic stage burning 
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. Missions to LEO would have featured a 16 ft-diameter 
payload fairing and two Aerojet Rocketdyne RL-10C-1 engines, with a payload capacity 
of 13,500 lb. GTO missions would have used a 13 ft fairing and a single RL-10C-1 
engine, with a payload capacity of approximately 4,500 lb. This vehicle would have 
had a gross weight of about 465,000 pounds.<br>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2">In 2014, Stratolaunch 
announced that it was considering multiple launch vehicle options over a range of 
satellite sizes, and that some development work on the Orbital launch vehicle has 
been slowed down to focus on completion of the carrier aircraft. <br>
In May 2015, it was announced that the Pegasus-II solid-fuel rocket was not achieving 
design economic goals and that Stratolaunch had contracted with the GenCorp division 
of Aerojet Rocketdyne to build the RL-10C-1 dual-motor liquid fuel engines for the 
launch vehicle.<br>
In 2015 Stratolaunch Systems was placed under the supervision of Paul Allen&#39;s new 
company Vulcan Aerospace, a subsidiary of Vulcan, Inc. Vulcan Aerospace has its 
heritage in SpaceShipOne and oversees the Stratolaunch Systems project. Vulcan ended 
its contract with Orbital ATK in mid-2015 and indicated that a decision on a new 
rocket for the Stratolaunch Carrier Aircraft would be made in late 2015.</font></p>
