<font color="#000080">announced that it has been awarded a major contract by the 
U.S. Air Force to provide space launch and missile defense target vehicles using 
deactivated Peacekeeper ICBM assets under the Orbital/Suborbital Program-2 (OSP-2).<br>
Orbital will combine Peacekeeper rocket motors with commercial launch vehicle technology 
derived from its Pegasus and Taurus rockets to develop and operate low-cost vehicles 
to launch U.S. government-funded satellites into low-Earth orbit. Capable of boosting 
payloads more than 1.75 tons into orbit.<br>
Under the Minuteman portion of the contract, Orbital will continue to provide target 
and Minotaur space launch services.</font></font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font color="#000080" size="2"><br>
The vehicle consists of three Peacekeeper solid rocket stages, a commercial Orion-38 
fourth stage motor and subsystems derived from our established space launch boosters. 
Under a 10-year contract with the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, 
Orbital will develop and operate the low-cost Minotaur-IV vehicle to launch U.S. 
government-funded satellites into low-Earth orbit.</font></p>

is a 5-stage evolutionary version of the Minotaur-IV to launch small spacecraft 
into high energy trajectories, including geosynchronous transfer orbits and translunar 
missions. The first three stages of the Minotaur-V are the unmodified Peacekeeper 
solid rocket motors. The forth and fifth stages are commercial motors. The stage 
four motor is nominally a Star-48BV configuration. the fifth stage can be either 
attitude controlled or spinning. The attitude controlled version nominally uses 
the same Orion-38 motor that has been extensively flight demonstrated on multiple 
Orbital launch vehicles. For a spinning configuration, a Star-37FMV is used to provide 
maximum performance. The Minotaur avionics, structures, and fairing are common with 
the Minotaur-IV SLV. Capable of boosting payloads&nbsp; than 553 to 710 kg&nbsp; 
into GTO.<br>

This variant of the Castor-120 predecessor is used as a first or second stage in 
commercial launch vehicles and provides improved performance over the baseline configuration. 
A version of this motor was static tested for the U.S. Air Force as part of the 
Large Class Stage development program, however the motor is being updated to tailor 
burn rates and improve performance, as well as utilize common materials &amp; processes 
to improve cost control for launch vehicle providers.<br>
In addition to Athena family, Castor-120XL is in preparation for Minotaur-C (ex-Taurus 
family) and </font><font color="#FF0000" size="2"><b>Minotaur-I</b></font><font color="#800080" size="2">
