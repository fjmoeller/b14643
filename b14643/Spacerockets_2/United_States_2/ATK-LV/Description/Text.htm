    <td width="63%"><font size="2" color="#000080">Alliant Techsystems (ATK) is 
    undergoing a four-phase development process that will ultimately lead to the 
    development of a family of low-cost, operationally responsive launch vehicles 
    capable of delivering 200 to 750 kg to LEO. </font>
    <p><font size="2" color="#000080">The first phase, ALV X-1, which is already 
    in testing, will be a sounding rocket program launched from Wallops Flight Facility. 
    It consists of an Orion-50SXL stage of Pegasus /
    <a target="_blank" href="../../../../Spacerockets/Specials/U.S._Intercept_Target_Missiles/Interceptor/Description/Frame.htm">
    OBV Interceptor</a> heritage and an thrust vectored Star-37FM motor as second 
    stage.<br>
    The second phase, for which funding has already been secured, will consist of 
    a two-stage, three-axis controlled vehicle capable of reaching suborbital heights 
    of up to 2,000 kilometers. <br>
    The unfunded third phase will be scaled-up version of the Phase Two vehicle 
    capable of delivering 225 - 350 kg to LEO, while the fourth phase, contingent 
    on government funding, would involve an advanced vehicle based on new technologies</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" color="#000080">During its inaugural flight, the ALV will 
    carry a hypersonic boundary layer transition experiment (Hy-BoLT) payload sponsored 
    by NASA&#39;s Hypersonics Project within the Fundamental Aeronautics Program. A 
    secondary payload consisting of a suborbital aerodynamic re-entry experiment 
    (SOAREX) is being developed by NASA Ames. The inaugural flight of the ALV will 
    be launched from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport, located at NASA&#39;s Wallops 
    Island Flight Facility.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" color="#000080">Next year&#39;s ALV X-1 flight is part of ATK&#39;s 
    plan to develop a low-cost launch vehicle for the operational responsive space 
    (ORS) market. Possible ORS programs include the delivery of small payloads to 
    low-earth orbit in support of DOD missions, NASA scientific missions, and commercial 
    and university satellite programs.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" color="#000080">The ATK Launch Vehicle (ALV) and ATK Small 
    Launch Vehicle (SLV), which both uses numerous off-the-shelf components and 
    requires minimal ground support to keep costs down.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" color="#000080">In 2008 it appeared, that only the protoype 
    would be flown as a demonstrator, but no further flights were planned.</font></p>
