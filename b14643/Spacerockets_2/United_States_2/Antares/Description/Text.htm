    <font size="2">NASA established the <b>Commercial Orbital Transportation Services 
    (COTS)</b> program to develop a competitive market for crew and cargo flights 
    to the International Space Station (ISS). The program breaks from the traditional 
    government contracting approach by allowing the private sector to develop, own, 
    and operate its own launch vehicles in service of NASA&#39;s ISS delivery needs. 
    Unlike today&#39;s Space Shuttle, the reusable launch vehicles (RLV&#39;s) developed 
    under COTS will also be able to serve commercial customers.<br>
    The original COTS announcement listed several capability requirements. These 
    included the ability to lift a combined total of &quot;up to&quot; 16 tonnes of cargo 
    per year to ISS using two to eight flights per year. Thus, the minimum launch 
    vehicle/cargo carrier would need to be able to haul at least 2 tonnes of cargo 
    per flight. <br>
    <br>
    In August 2006, NASA announced its competitive selection of <b>Space Exploration 
    Technologies</b> (SpaceX) and <b>Rocketplane-Kistler</b> (RpK) as partners in 
    the COTS program.<br>
    <br>
    In November 2007, <b>PlanetSpace</b> company, announced that it had teamed with 
    aerospace giants <b>Lockheed Martin and ATK</b> to submit a proposal response 
    for NASA&#39;s COTS (Commercial Orbital Transportation Services) program. The proposal 
    was triggered by NASA&#39;s October 18, 2007 decision to cancel Rocketplane-Kistler&#39;s 
    original COTS contract.<br>

On February 19, 2008, NASA awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services 
(COTS) Demonstration Mission to Orbital. The project award was expected to be combined 
to develop Taurus II and a new &quot;maneuvering spacecraft&quot; named &quot;<b>Cygnus</b>&quot;.<br>
Taurus II and Cygnus would be developed to perform a demonstration of commercial 
cargo delivery to the International Space Station (ISS). Cygnus would carry up to 
2.3 tonnes of pressurized and unpressurized cargo on speciallized interchangeable 
modules. A reentry version would be able to return as much as 1.2 tonnes of cargo 
from ISS to Earth. <br>
On December 23, 2008, NASA awarded Commercial Resupply Services (CRS) contract to 
Orbital, purchasing eight ISS resupply missions to be launched by Taurus II/Cygnus 
from Wallops Island.<br>
ATK will provide the </font><b><font size="2" color="#FF0000">CASTOR 30XL</font></b><font color="#000080" size="2">,

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2"><b>2014, December </b>
-- Orbital Sciences Corp. says it will resume flights of its Cygnus cargo spacecraft 
to the International Space Station (ISS) using United Launch Alliance (ULA) Atlas 
5 401 rockets starting in September 2015. Orbital has contracted with ULA for an 
Atlas V launch of Cygnus from Cape Canaveral, Florida with an option for a second 
Atlas V launch in 2016 if needed. Orbital says the Atlas rocket’s greater lift capacity 
will allow Cygnus to carry nearly 35% more cargo to the ISS than previously planned 
for CRS missions in 2015.<br>
<br>
Since an October failure of the Antares rocket, Orbital has confirmed its ability 
to accelerate the introduction of a <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><b>new 
main propulsion system</b></span> for the Antares rocket and has scheduled three 
additional CRS launches in the first, second and fourth quarters of 2016 using the 
upgraded vehicle. The greater payload performance of the upgraded Antares will permit 
Cygnus spacecraft on each of these missions to deliver over 20% more cargo than 
in prior plans. Orbital says with necessary supplier contracts now in place, the 
first new propulsion systems are expected to arrive at the Antares final assembly 
facility at Wallops in mid-2015 to begin vehicle integration and testing.<br>
Orbital has yet to publicly disclose the supplier, but among propulsion options 
considered were continued use of the NK-33, production of which could have been 
restarted in Russia; a solid-motor solution proposed by ATK; and a variant of the 
Russian RD-180.<br>
<br>
Now Orbital has published, it will be a variant of the Russian RD-180 (the<b>
<a target="_blank" href="../../../../Spacerockets/Specials/Russian_Rocket_engines/RD-181.jpg">
RD-181</a></b>).</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" color="#800080"><b>2015, 
July</b> -- Orbital Sciences Corp. and RKK Energia have signed a contract worth 
approximately $1 billion for up to <span style="background-color: #FFFF00"><b>60 Russian-made RD-181 rocket engines</b></span> to power 
the redesigned first stage of the commercial Antares launcher. Orbital Sciences 
Corp. will have directly from Russia’s NPO Energomash the new rocket engine. The 
first pair of RD-181 rocket engines set to launch on Orbital ATK’s redesigned Antares 
rocket are in the final stages of acceptance testing in Russia ahead of their export 
to the United States in early July 2015. The first Antares flight with RD-181 engines 
is scheduled for March 2016, Orbital ATK officials said. The new RD-181 engines 
consume the same propellant mixture as the old AJ26 engines. Two engines providing 
a combined 820,000 pounds of thrust at full throttle.</font></p>
