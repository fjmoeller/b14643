The </font><b><font color="#FF0000">K-1</font></b><font color="#000080"> is a new 
two-stage reusable launch vehicle being developed commercially by </font>
<font color="#FF0000">Kistler Aerospace Corporation</font><font color="#000080">. 
The K-1 can carry&nbsp; payloads to 4.6 tons LEO and 1.25 tons SSO. Both stages 
are recovered using parachutes and airbags.<br>
The first stage&nbsp; is referred to as the Launch Assist Platform (LAP). The second 
stage is called the Orbital Vehicle (OV).<br>
Spacecraft are carried in a reusable payload modul (PM) rather than a conventional 
payload fairing. Three types are available - the Sandard Payload Modul (SPM), Extended 
Payload Modul (EPM), and Active Dispenser Payload Module (ADPM). <br>
Launch operations will be conducted from new launch facilities in Australia (Woomera) 
and Nevada (Nevada Test Site).<br>
Both stage burn Kerosene/LOX propellants and are powered by modernized versions 
of Russian Kuznetsov NK-33 and NK-34 engines. The K-1 first stage engines derived 
from the NK-33 are designated the AJ-26-58 (single-start) or AJ-26-59 (restart). 
The second stage engine derived from the NK-43 is designated the AJ-26-60. An optional 
expendable third stage, fueled by MMH/N2O4, can be used for high-orbit missions.<br>
<br>
The K-1 includes a new Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) that burns Ethanol/LOX propellants. 
It is based on development work done at Aerojet&nbsp; in the 1980s intended to create 
a nontoxic propulsion system to replace the Space Shuttle ACS engines use UDMH/N2O4 
propellants. The K-1 OMS system consists of two spherical propellant tanks in the 
aft compartment of OV second stage.<br>
The first stage&nbsp; includes a smaller LOX retention tank inside the kerosene 
tank. This tank retains the LOX needed to restart the main engine for the return 
of the first stage to the launch site.<br>

<font color="#000080" size="2">Orbital Sciences will oversee the final development, 
production and launch operations activities of Kistler&#39;s K-1 reusable launch vehicle 
system. Kistler’s K-1 vehicle was selected by the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration (NASA) for the space agency&#39;s <b>Commercial Orbital Transportation 
System (COTS) program</b> to provide unmanned cargo transportation services to and 
from the International Space Station (ISS).<br>
In implementing the COTS program, Kistler will contract with Orbital for the final 
development, integration, testing and first launches of the K-1 rocket to the ISS 
in 2008 and 2009. The company will build on the substantial development work already 
accomplished by the Kistler team over the past decade. Orbital&#39;s role in the program 
encompasses program management support to Kistler and lead responsibility for systems 
engineering and vehicle integration, launch operations, and safety and mission assurance.<br>

announced that it had teamed with aerospace giants <b>Lockheed Martin and ATK</b> 
to submit a proposal response for NASA&#39;s COTS (Commercial Orbital Transportation 
Services) program. The proposal was triggered by NASA&#39;s October 18, 2007 decision 
to cancel Rocketplane-Kistler&#39;s original COTS contract.</font></p>
