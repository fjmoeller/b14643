    <font color="#FF0000"><b>16 April 2018</b></font><font color="#000080"> — During 
    the 34th annual Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Colorado, Orbital ATK provided 
    a detailed update on the important progress being made on its Next Generation 
    Launch System.<br>
    The company reaffirmed its commitment to the U.S. Air Force’s Evolved Expendable 
    Launch Vehicle (EELV) program for national security space missions with the 
    announcement of the name of the rocket, </font><b><font color="#FF0000">OmegA</font><font color="#000080">

    O and A at the beginning and end reflect the Orbital ATK name</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Times New Roman">)</span>, 
    and the selection of its upper stage propulsion system. As one of the company’s 
    largest strategic investments, OmegA will provide intermediate- to heavy-class 
    launch services for Department of Defense, civil government and commercial customers 
    beginning in three years.<br>
    <font size="2"><br>
    </font>The rocket configuration consists of Orbital ATK-built first and second 
    solid rocket stages, strap-on solid boosters and a cryogenic liquid upper stage. 
    After careful consideration, Orbital ATK recently selected Aerojet Rocketdyne’s 
    RL-10C model to be OmegA’s upper stage propulsion engine. The new variant
    </font><font color="#FF0000">RL-10C-5</font><font color="#000080"> of the RL-10C 
    engine will feature an injector assembly that is built using additive manufacturing, 
    or 3-D printing.<br>
    <font size="2"><br>
    </font>After initial flights of its intermediate configuration in 2021, OmegA 
    will be certified for operational EELV missions starting in 2022 with initial 
    heavy configuration flights beginning in 2024.<br>

    <p><font size="2"><b>Orbital ATK</b> chairman and chief executive David Thompson 
    said that the company will decide next year (2017) whether to proceed with the 
    Next-Generation Launcher program.<br>
    <br>
    The three-stage rocket would be made of two solid-fueled lower stages, each 
    made in-house by Orbital ATK, and a cryogenic third stage consuming liquid hydrogen 
    and liquid oxygen. The engine for the third stage would be the BE-3U powerplant, 
    a derivative of the engine Blue Origin currently flies on its New Shepard suborbital 
    rocket.<br>
    The basic version of the Next-Generation Launcher would have a two-segment Castor 
    600 first stage, topped with a Castor 300 second stage motor, which is essentially 
    one segment of the rocket’s first stage.<br>
    The solid-fueled motors are similar to the solid rocket boosters Orbital ATK 
    and its predecessor companies built for the Space Shuttle and NASA’s Space Launch 
    System. But the new rocket’s motors would use pre-packed propellants inside 
    composite cases, which are lighter than the metallic steel casings flown on 
    the Shuttle and SLS. That development of the lightweight casings is one focus 
    of the Air Force’s initial funding award to Orbital ATK earlier this year. The 
    two-segment Castor 600 first stage could be lengthened to a four-segment version 
    called the Castor 1200.<br>
    Up to six strap-on solid rocket boosters — the same 63-inch-diameter auxiliary 
    motors Orbital ATK is developing for ULA’s Vulcan and Atlas 5 rockets — could 
    be stacked around the base of the Next-Generation Launcher.<br>
    <b><font color="#FF0000">The BE-3U engine</font></b> on the 5.25-meter diameter 
    (17.2-foot) third stage would produce up to 120,000 pounds of thrust and fire 
    multiple times per mission. A payload shroud spanning 5.25 meters (17.2 feet) 
    in diameter will top off Orbital ATK’s proposed rocket.<br>
    The basic intermediate-class launcher, without strap-on motors, can put about 
    12,125 pounds (5.5 metric tons) into geostationary transfer orbit, the destination 
    for most commercial and military communications satellites.<br>
    The new launcher shares some design elements with the Liberty rocket concept 
    pushed by ATK, one of Orbital ATK’s predecessor companies, after the retirement 
    of the space shuttle. The Liberty launcher would have had a large solid-fueled 
    first stage resembling the shuttle’s booster and a cryogenic upper stage based 
    on Europe’s Ariane 5 rocket.<br>
    The rocket now proposed by Orbital ATK would use different propulsion systems, 
    but like Liberty, it would be assembled in the VAB and blast off from pad 39B.</font></p>
