    <p align="left"><font size="2" color="#000080">The <b>Space Launch System ( 
    SLS)</b> is a Shuttle-Derived heavy launch vehicle being designed by NASA, following 
    the cancellation of the Constellation Program, to replace the Space Shuttle 
    after its retirement.<br>
    The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 envisions the transformation of the <b>Ares 
    I</b> <b>and Ares V</b> vehicle designs into a single launch vehicle usable 
    for both crew and cargo. It is to be upgraded over time with more powerful versions. 
    The initial capability of the core elements, without an upper stage, should 
    be for between 70 tons and 100 tons into LEO in preparation for transit for 
    missions beyond low-Earth orbit. With the addition of integrated upper Earth 
    departure stage the total lift capability of the Space Launch System should 
    be 130 tons or more.<br>
    Preliminary designs indicate that the current </font>
    <font size="2" color="#FF0000">Space Shuttle Main Engines</font><font size="2" color="#000080"> 
    and Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters would be utilized, and much of the External 
    Tank design would remain the same. This design would require dramatically less 
    development time than the Ares V heavy lift launch vehicle. On May 24, 2011, 
    NASA announced that development of the Orion from the Constellation program 
    will continue under the name Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (<b>MPCV</b>).<br>
    Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV) is a planned spacecraft that is being designed 
    by Lockheed Martin for NASA, the space agency of the United States, based on 
    designs and tests already completed for the Orion spacecraft. The MPCV was annouced 
    by NASA on 24 May 2011.<br>
    The MPCV spacecraft includes both crew and service modules, and a spacecraft 
    adaptor. The MPCV is being developed for different crewed missions. The capsule 
    is also planned as a backup vehicle for cargo and crewed missions to the International 
    Space Station. It will be launched by the Space Launch System.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" color="#000080">The <b>SLS</b> would be developed in two phases. 
    Phase One would not include an upper stage. Phase Two would add an upper stage.<br>
    An &quot;inline&quot; core built using Shuttle External Tank (ET) tooling, powered by 
    existing Space Shuttle Main Engines (RS-25D), boosted by a pair of five segment 
    reusable solid rocket boosters (RSRBs).<br>
    In Phase Two the SLS could be augmented with a cryogenic upper stage. The stage 
    would serve both to perform the final burn to reach LEO, and to provide beyond 
    propulsion. The HEFT study left open the question of engine-type. The J-2X could 
    it be, or a cluster of RL-10 derived &quot;Next Generation Engines&quot;. The upper stage 
    could boost 118 tonnes to LEO or more as 50 tonnes to escape velocity.</font></p>

    The SLS will use a liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propulsion system, which 
    will include the RS-25D/E from the Space Shuttle Program for the core stage 
    and the Saturn V-derived J-2X rocket engine for the upper stage. However, initial 
    development flights will also use solid rocket boosters. The SLS will have an 
    initial lift capacity of 70 metric tons (154,324 lbs), which NASA points out 
    is roughly the weight of 40 SUVs. An evolved SLS will then see lift capacity 
    increased to 130 metric tons (286,600 lbs).<br>
    The initial SLS will weigh 2,500 metric tons and stand&nbsp; 97.5 m (320 ft) 
    high. At liftoff it will generate 8.4 million pounds of thrust. The subsequent 
    evolved SLS will weigh 2,950 metric tons and stand 122 m (400 ft) high. At liftoff 
    it will generate 9.2 million pounds of thrust.<br>
    <br>
    NASA says the SLS&#39;s architecture provides a launch vehicle that can be adapted 
    to suit different missions through the use of different core stage, upper stage, 
    and first-stage booster combinations. This flexibility is designed to allow 
    it to more economically carry the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, as well 
    as cargo, equipment and science experiments to as low as Earth&#39;s orbit and as 
    far as Mars and beyond. While NASA is looking to save money by having private 
    companies ferry astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS), the SLS 
    will also serve as a backup for commercial and international partner transportation 
    services to the ISS.<br>
