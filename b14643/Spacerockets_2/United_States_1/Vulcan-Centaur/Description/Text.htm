    </font><font color="#000080">Building on a history of launch success and introducing 
    advanced new technologies, United Launch Alliance’s (ULA) Vulcan-Centaur rocket 
    is transforming the future of space launch including the commercial satellite 
    market.<br>
    “The Vulcan-Centaur provides our customers with greater affordability and flexibility. 
    This new rocket enables us to launch the entire market segment for all sizes 
    of satellites from large government and commercial satellites to small satellites”,said 
    Tory Bruno, President and CEO of ULA.<br>
    <font size="1"><br>
    </font>The Vulcan-Centaur is a 5.4 meter diameter, two stage, liquid fueled 
    rocket. The booster is powered by a pair of </font><font color="#FF0000">BE-4 
    engines</font><font color="#000080"> burning liquefied natural gas (LNG) and 
    liquid oxygen, and together producing 1.1 million pounds of thrust at liftoff. 
    Performance can be tailored to meet mission requirements by adding two, four 
    or six solid rocket boosters </font><font color="#FF0000">GEM 63XL</font><font color="#000080"> 
    increasing the maximum thrust to 3.8 million pounds.<br>
    Centaur is a high energy, upper stage that is capable of multiple restarts and 
    long duration missions. It is a liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen-fueled vehicle 
    and is powered by </font><font color="#FF0000">RL-10C engines</font><font color="#000080">.<br>
    Approximately 90 percent of the major components and systems derive their design 
    heritage from Atlas and Delta and, in many cases, are currently flying on these 
    vehicles.<br>
    Some of the systems currently flying include the complete avionics suite, the 
    RL-10C upper stage engine and the large composite payload fairing.<br>
    The increased performance and on-orbit capabilities of Vulcan-Centaur enable 
    direct insertion to multiple orbits including geostationary as well as the ability 
    to dual and triple manifest GEO communications satellites.<br>
    Currently in production, the Vulcan-Centaur provides an opportunity to improve 
    upon the proven reliability of Atlas V and Delta IV rockets originally designed 
    two decades ago.<br>

    <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><i><font size="2">The NGLS <b>Vulcan</b> 
    is a new space launcher under development by ULA (United Launch Alliance) to 
    replace both the Atlas-V and Delta-IV families.<br>
    The first step in the developing is developing a new first stage featuring the 
    methane-fueled BE-4 engine by Blue Origin. ULA is also working with Aerojet 
    Rocketdyne on the AR-1 engine, in case the BE-4 runs into delays. ULAs first 
    choice is the BE-4 but that it continues to fund the AR-1 work as a backup option, 
    and that ULA will make a final decision on in 2016.<br>
    In addition to the new engine, the Vulcans first stage would feature a stretch 
    version of the tank used on ULAs Delta-IV rocket, which the company is phasing 
    out in 2018 because it is too expensive. The second stage of the initial Vulcan 
    version, slated to debut around 2019, would feature the same Centaur upper stage 
    and fairing now used on the Atlas-V.<br>
    The Vulcan could be augmented by up to six solid rocket boosters, giving it 
    greater lift capability than the largest version of the Atlas-V. ULA plans to 
    issue a request for proposals within the next 12 months for the large boosters, 
    which would likely be built by either Orbital ATK (GEM-63XL) or Aerojet Rocketdyne.<br>
    The next step in Vulcans evolution is a new upper stage known as the Advanced 
    Cryogenic Evolved Stage, or ACES, which could be able to operate in space for 
    weeks at a time. This would open up a whole new range of missions to the Vulcan.<br>
    The ACES stage would have anywhere from one to four cryogenic engines, depending 
    on the mission. The candidate engines are: A new variant of the RL-10 produced 
    by Aerojet Rocketdyne and currently used on both the Atlas-V and Delta-IV; Blue 
    Origins BE-3U; and a piston-pump engine being jointly developed with XCOR aerospace.</font></i></p>

All plans to put Centaur III on Vulcan Centaur were dropped long ago. Also dropped 
were all variants with a 4m payload fairing. Vulcan Centaur will use only the &quot;full 
diameter&quot; upper stage you depict, with two RL10C-1-1 engines equipped with nozzle 
extensions. Only 5m payload fairings will be flown. Early versions of the upper 
stage will have a traditional hydrazine attitude control system as well.<br>
