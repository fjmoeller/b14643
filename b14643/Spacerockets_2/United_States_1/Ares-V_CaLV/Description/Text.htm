will use five RS-68 liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen engines on a 10-meter diameter 
core with two five-segment RSRMs for the first stage. The upper, &quot;Earth Departure&quot; 
stage will also be powered by a single J-2X engine. Ares V will stand more than 
109 meters tall, will weigh 3,356 tonnes at liftoff, and will be able to lift about 
130 tonnes to low Earth orbit.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font size="2" color="#000080">An early change increased the diameter of the upper 
stage and payload shroud to 10 meters, matching the core diameter. Additional changes 
included increased RSRM nozzle length, changes to the solid propellant mix, improved 
RSRM vacuum specific impulse, bettered RS-68 thrust and specific impulse, and increased 
use of lighter weight composite structures.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">
<font size="2" color="#000080">On June 23, 2008, NASA announced that the Ares V 
baseline design had grown larger and more powerful than previous designs. The trans-lunar 
insertion (TLI) capability had risen to 71 tonnes, a 7 tonne increase. The theoretical 
Low Earth Orbit (LEO) payload had grown to 145 tonnes or more from the previous 
130 tonnes. <br>
Planners added a sixth RS-68 engine to the core stage and specified a pair of five-and-a-half 
segment solid rocket boosters. The previous design used five RS-68s and two five-segment 
boosters. The core stage was lengthened. The Earth Departure Stage (EDS) diameter 
had already been increased to 10 meters to match the core diameter during recent 
design iterations. The payload fairing diameter also grew to 10 meters. Overall 
height jumped to 116.16 meters, 5.56 meters taller than Saturn V. Lift-off weight 
increased to 3,699.23 tonnes and lift-off thrust to an unprecedented 5,306 tonnes.</font></p>
