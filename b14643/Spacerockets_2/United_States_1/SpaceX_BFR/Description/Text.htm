    <td width="73%">&nbsp;<p><font color="#000080"><b>BFR</b> is SpaceX&#39;s large rocket project. The launch 
    vehicle consists of the booster Super Heavy and an upper stage called Starship, 
    which is also intended to serve as a spaceship. Both stages are powered by Raptor 
    engines. The declared goal is the development of a fully reusable carrier system 
    for a payload of over 100 tons.<br>
    On September 29, 2017, Elon Musk presented his rocket concept called BFR (Big 
    Falcon Rocket) for the first time at the 68th International Astronautical Congress. 
    Since then, the design of the rocket has changed several times.<br>
    <font size="1"><br>
    </font><u>Booster stage (Super Heavy)</u><br>
    The first stage, known as Super Heavy, is now to be equipped with 33 Raptor-2 
    engines. An inner group of  3 engines would be swiveling mounted and would provide 
    thrust vectoring. The approximately 70 m high stage with a diameter of 9 m is 
    to land on the launch pad after separation. SpaceX wants to try to land the 
    stage in a catcher right at the launch tower on the launch pad.<br>
    The original planning called for carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) for 
    the load-bearing structure and the tanks. From the end of 2018, a switch was 
    made to a stainless steel construction.<br>
    <font size="1"><br>
    </font><u>Upper stage (Starship)</u><br>
    For the planned engine design of the Starship upper stage, SpaceX decided to 
    use six Raptor engines, 3 of them identical to those of the first stage and 
    3 vacuum-optimized engines (later 6 engines ?). As with the Super Heavy, thrust 
    vectoring is provided for the inner ring of three swiveling mounted engines.<br>
    As with the the Super Heavy, the tanks evolved from a CFRP design to a construction 
    of welded together sheets of stainless chromium-nickel steel. The outer hull 
    of the Starship is to be covered with thin ceramic heat protection tiles.<br>
    In contrast to conventional rocket designs, the upper stage is firmly connected 
    to the payload section. The total length is 50 m.<br>
    The Starship has four lateral wings as control and landing aids. Two small wings 
    are attached to the top of the spaceship, two larger wings are attached to the 
    bottom.<br>
    The upper stage is planned in at least six different versions: freighter for 
    large payloads, as a tanker, as an orbital fuel depot, as a spaceship for passenger 
    and cargo transport and as a lunar module.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000">A first launch of the BFR system is planned for summer 
    2022. The Booster BN7 and the Starship SN24 are to be used for this. Both stages 
    will already be equipped with Raptor-2 engines. The risk of a successful orbital 
    flight and subsequent landing is great, because there have been no flight tests 
    of the newly configured stages.</font></p>
