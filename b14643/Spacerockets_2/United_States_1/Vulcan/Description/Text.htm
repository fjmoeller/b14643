    </font><font color="#FF0000"><b>Vulcan</b></font><font color="#000080"> is a 
    ne space launcher under development by ULA (United Launch Alliance) to replace 
    both the Atlas-V and Delta-IV families.<br>
    <br>
    The first step in the developing is developing a new first stage featuring the
    </font><font color="#FF0000">methane-fueled BE-4 engine</font><font color="#000080"> 
    by <a target="_blank" href="../../B.O._New-Glenn/Description/Frame.htm">Blue Origin</a>. ULA is also working with Aerojet Rocketdyne on the AR-1 engine, 
    in case the BE-4 runs into delays. ULAs first choice is the BE-4 but that it 
    continues to fund the AR-1 work as a backup option, and that ULA will make a 
    final decision on in 2016.<br>
    <br>
    In addition to the new engine, the Vulcans first stage would feature a stretch 
    version of the tank used on ULAs Delta-IV rocket, which the company is phasing 
    out in 2018 because it is too expensive. The second stage of the initial Vulcan 
    version, slated to debut around 2019, would feature the same </font>
    <font color="#FF0000">Centaur upper stag</font><font color="#000080">e and fairing 
    now used on the Atlas-V.<br>
    <br>
    The Vulcan could be augmented by up to six solid rocket boosters, giving it 
    greater lift capability than the largest version of the Atlas-V. ULA plans to 
    issue a request for proposals within the next 12 months for the large boosters, 
    which would likely be built by either <u>Orbital ATK</u> (</font><font color="#FF0000">GEM-63XL</font><font color="#000080">) or Aerojet 
    Rocketdyne.<br>
    <br>
    The next step in Vulcans evolution is a new upper stage known as the Advanced 
    Cryogenic Evolved Stage, or </font><font color="#FF0000">ACES</font><font color="#000080">, 
    which could be able to operate in space for weeks at a time. This would open 
    up a whole new range of missions to the Vulcan.<br>
    <br>
    The ACES stage would have anywhere from one to four cryogenic engines, depending 
    on the mission. The candidate engines are: a new variant of the RL-10 produced 
    by Aerojet Rocketdyne and currently used on both the Atlas-V and Delta-IV; Blue 
    Origins BE-3U; and a piston-pump engine being jointly developed with XCOR aerospace.</font></p>
