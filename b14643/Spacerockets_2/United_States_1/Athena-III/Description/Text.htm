    <td width="76%"><font color="#000080"><font size="2">NASA established the <b>
    Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS)</b> program to develop a competitive 
    market for crew and cargo flights to the International Space Station (ISS). 
    The program breaks from the traditional government contracting approach by allowing 
    the private sector to develop, own, and operate its own launch vehicles in service 
    of NASA&#39;s ISS delivery needs. Unlike today&#39;s Space Shuttle, the reusable launch 
    vehicles (RLV&#39;s) developed under COTS will also be able to serve commercial 
    customers.<br>
    The original COTS announcement listed several capability requirements. These 
    included the ability to lift a combined total of &quot;up to&quot; 16 tonnes of cargo 
    per year to ISS using two to eight flights per year. Thus, the minimum launch 
    vehicle/cargo carrier would need to be able to haul at least 2 tonnes of cargo 
    per flight. <br>
    <br>
    In August 2006, NASA announced its competitive selection of <b>Space Exploration 
    Technologies</b> (SpaceX) and <b>Rocketplane-Kistler</b> (RpK) as partners in 
    the COTS program.<br>
    <br>
    In November 2007, <b>PlanetSpace</b> company, announced that it had teamed with 
    aerospace giants <b>Lockheed Martin and ATK</b> to submit a proposal response 
    for NASA&#39;s COTS (Commercial Orbital Transportation Services) program. The proposal 
    was triggered by NASA&#39;s October 18, 2007 decision to cancel Rocketplane-Kistler&#39;s 
    original COTS contract.<br>

    Meanwhile, it can be contemplated alongside other proposed launch vehicles like
    <b>Orbital Sciences</b> Taurus II and <b>SpaceX</b> Falcon 9.</font></span></font><p>

    rocket would stand somewhere in the 52 meter height range, including 10 meter 
    long payload fairing, would weigh 439 tonnes at lift-off.<br>
    The first stage would be based on ATK&#39;s Space Shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket 
    Motor (RSRM). It would use 2.5 motor segments.<br>
    The second stage would be an ATK Castor 120 motor.<br>
    The third stage would use a new ATK Castor 30 motor. Castor 30 should be loaded 
    with 13,000 kg of propellant at launch. ATK has been developing Castor 30.&nbsp; 
    Castor 30 appears to match the reported second stage requirements of Orbital 
    Sciences Taurus-II COTS launch vehicle proposal.<br>
    The launch vehicle would be topped by an Orbit Adjust Module (OAM) of the type 
    previously flown on Lockheed Martin&#39;s Athena-I and -II launch vehicles. OAM 
    was a pressure-fed monomethylhydrazine (MMH) propulsion system that provided 
    on-orbit maneuvering and trim. <br>
    The new launch vehicle would be able to lift about 6 metric tons (tonnes) to 
    low earth orbit (LEO), using existing Shuttle SRB-style steel motor casings. 
    New composite first stage motor casings would improve LEO performance to 6.71 
    tonnes. ATK said that the launch vehicle (presumably the composite case version) 
    would be able to boost 2.79 tonnes to geosynchronous transfer orbit, 1.88 tonnes 
    to a trans-lunar trajectory, and 1.36 tonnes toward Mars.</font></p>
