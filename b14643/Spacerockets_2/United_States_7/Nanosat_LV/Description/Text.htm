<font size="2" color="#FF0000">California State University</font><font size="2" color="#000080"> 
Long Beach (CSULB) in the California Launch Vehicle Education Initiative (CALVEIN). 
Primary objectives of this initiative are to help prepare the next generation of 
California-based launch vehicle design engineers, while also supporting technology 
and infrastructure development.<br>
The baseline </font><font size="2" color="#FF0000">Nanosat Launch Vehicle</font><font size="2" color="#000080"> 
concept is a 2-stage pressure-fed LOX-densified propylene vehicle. The chamber pressure 
is nominally 2 MPa (300 psi) for the first stage and 1 MPa (150 psi) for the upper 
stage. The constraint that the vehicle be pressure-fed leads to structural design 
challenges. In order to limit the amount of gas needed to pressurize the vehicle, 
the cold gaseous helium is warmed, either via a heat exchanger at the oxygen and 
hydrogen in the helium which reacts over a catalysts bed.<br>
The baseline vehicle was the result of trade studies conducted in order to obtain 
a system with as high a structural dry mass fraction as possible for each stage 
while keeping lift-off and payload masses constant. The result was a first stage 
structural mass fraction of 13.1 % and a second stage structural mass fraction of 
13.7%. While with these numbers an all-aluminium second stage is doable (tank pressures 
are around 1.25 MPa – 185 psi), the first stage (operating at higher pressures) 
ought to use composite materials.<br>
In order to assess the benefits of using an aerospike engine for the first stage 
instead of the conventional bell shape nozzle, the model was modified to simulate 
the near ideal thrust coefficient which can be obtain when operating at pressure 
ratios below the design point (after which the aerospike engine essentially behaves 
like a bell, being underexpanded). In order to account for the typical lower nozzle 
efficiency when the spike is truncated at approximately 20% of its ideal length, 
the nozzle efficiency was reduced from 98 to 96%.<br>
When this aerospike engine with an expansion ratio of 40 is substituted to the first 
stage conventional engine (which features an expansion ratio of 12), the available 
first stage structural mass fraction increases to 14.3%, which corresponds to having 
an additional 16 kg available for the stage structure. This relaxed requirement 
on structural mass is due to the increase in specific impulse during the first stage 
burn when compared to the baseline vehicle. The payload capability grew by 23%, 
reaching 12.3 kg<br>
Since then, the team has focused on preliminary development of a Nanosat Launch 
Vehicle for delivering &gt;10 kg payloads to Low Earth Orbit. R&amp;D tasks have fallen 
into two parallel paths. The first involves static fire testing of the Propylene/LOX 
propellant combination that has been baselined for both NLV stages. The second involves 
testing of full-scale, low-fidelity prototypes of various NLV elements. The Prospector 
5 represented the initial such test vehicle, specifically the first stage. The Prospector 
6 in turn featured the re-furbished P-5 stage, in combination with an interstage 
element and a second stage simulator, to implement a full-scale, low-fidelity prototype 
of the full-scale NLV. Key accomplishments with the P-6 included stage separation, 
recovery of both the first stage/interstage and second stage simulator/payload fairing 
assemblies and successful operation of three student payloads.<br>
Refurbished and upgraded version of the Prospector 6 vehicle that flew in May 2005. 
It is the full scale of the proposed Nanosat Launch Vehicle and features a low-fidelity 
first stage (same basic unit that flew on both the Prospector 5 and 6), interstage, 
inactive second stage simulator and a payload fairing. Unlike the recoverable P-5 
and P-6, current plans call for a ballistic descent and crash landing.<br>
Previous team achievements include the first ever powered flight tests of a liquid-propellant 
aerospike engine in 2003. Future versions of such aerospike engines may be used 
to improve the performance of later iterations of the NLV. </font></p>
