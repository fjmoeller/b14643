payload carriers. The SSI vehicle is know as </font>

It is 1,2 m in diameter and almost 14 m tall; the addition of a nose cone and engine 
brings the final length to over 17 m. The pressure-fed engine has a potential thrust 
of 333 kN, although the first prototype reached only 265 kN and uses a coaxial pintle 
system like that on expendable launch vehicles and in the Apollo lunar module descent 
engine. This particular engine burns JP-4 kerosene as fuel with liquid oxygen as 
an oxidizer.<br>
In 05.08.1981 the first rocket was destroyed during a static test. SSI have extensivaly 
revised their plans. The company has made a formal decision to switch to a multi-stage 
solid rocket to be designated the &quot;<a href="../../Conestoga/Description/Frame.htm" target="_parent"><b>Conestoga</b></a>&quot;.<u><br>

A privately-funded commercial launch vehicle built by Houston-based Space Services,

a 1981 launch failure of its first, liquid-fuelled rocket named </font>
<font size="2" color="#FF0000">Percheron</font><font color="#000080" size="2">, 
SSI successfully tested its solid-propellant Conestoga-1, based on a Minuteman second 
stage engine, in 1982. However, the first operational flight of the rocket and the 
attempted launch of NASA’s Meteor satellite in 1995 failed when the vehicle was 
destroyed 45 seconds into its first stage burn. There have been no further launches.</font></p>
