    A sub-scale demonstration vehicle made its first flight on November 13, 2006.&nbsp; 
    It followed two more flights.<br>
    The full-scale vehicle was expected to be operational for revenue service in 
    2010. The overall vehicle was roughly conical. Propulsion would be by Hydrogen-Peroxide 
    and Kerosene (RP-1). The spacecraft was said to have a propellant load of 48,534 
    kg of HP oxidizer and 5,897 kg of RP-1 fuel and a thrust of 1,020 kN ( <u>nine&nbsp; 
    BE-1 engines ?</u>). The mission profile was said to include 110 seconds of 
    powered flight with engine cutoff at 38 km altitude. This concept was abandoned 
    in favor of NASAS&#39;s&nbsp; CCDev-2.<u><br>
    <br>
    </u>Blue Origin now is planning to develop a reusable launch vehicle to carry 
    a biconic seven-seat capsule to low Earth orbit, following an interim step when 
    the company will offer suborbital tourist and scientific flights in a three-seat 
    version.<br>

    of the suborbital vehicle is test-flown up to now in two times. </font>
    </font>The first flight was a short hop with successful soft landing. The second 
    flight went out of control at a height of 13.7 km at a speed of Mach 1.2. The 
    vehicle was destroyed. This prototype used the same propulsion as the &quot;Goddard&quot;,
    <u>but only three engines BE-2</u>.<u><font size="2"><font color="#000080"><br>

    a powerful new hydrogen- and oxygen-fueled rocket engine BE-3 at the company&#39;s 
    West Texas facility. Blue Origin&#39;s Orbital Launch Vehicle will use the BE-3 
    engine to propel the company&#39;s Space Vehicle into orbit. During the test, the 
    engine demonstrated a full mission duty cycle by thrusting at <b>110,000 pounds</b> 
    in a 145-second boost phase, shutting down to simulate coast through apogee. 
    The engine then restarted and throttled down to 25,000 pounds thrust to simulate 
    controlled vertical landing. The engine firing comes about a year after the 
    BE-3&#39;s thrust chamber was tested at NASA&#39;s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi.</font><font size="1"><br>

    </font><font size="2" color="#000080"><b>2014, Sept. 18</b> -- United Launch 
    Alliance and Blue Origin Announce Partnership To Develop New American Rocket 
    Engine.<br>
    &quot;United Launch Alliance (ULA), the nation&#39;s premier space launch company, and 
    Blue Origin, LLC, a privately-funded aerospace company owned by Amazon.com founder 
    Jeff Bezos, announced that they have entered into an agreement to jointly fund 
    development of the new ORSC cycle rocket engine BE-4 by Blue Origin. This new 
    collaboration will allow ULA to maintain the heritage, success and reliability 
    of its rocket families - Atlas and Delta - while addressing the long-term need 
    for a new domestic engine.<br>
    &quot;The BE-4 is a liquid oxygen, liquefied natural gas (LNG) rocket engine that 
    delivers 550,000-lbf of thrust at sea level. Two BE-4s will power the planned 
    new ULA launcher, providing 1,100,000-lbf thrust at liftoff. &quot;<b><br>
    <br>
    2015, April 07</b> -- Blue Origin recently completed acceptance testing of its 
    BE-3 rocket engine. The 110,000-lbf BE-3 will power Blue Origin’s New Shepard 
    suborbital system, and later, will be modified for upper stage applications.<br>
    The BE-3 can be continuously throttled between 110,000-lbf and 20,000-lbf thrust, 
    a key capability for vertical takeoff and vertical landing vehicles. The testing 
    profile included multiple mission duty cycles, deep throttling and off-nominal 
    test points.<br>
    <br>
    <b>2015, April 29</b> -- Blue Origin flew the first developmental test flight 
    of New Shepard space vehicle (PM-3). The 110,000-lbf thrust liquid hydrogen, 
    liquid oxygen BE-3 engine worked flawlessly, powering New Shepard through Mach 
    3 to its planned test altitude of 307,000 feet (93.5 km).<br>
    <br>
    <b>2015, August 16</b> -- Blue Origin announced plans to build a new rocket 
    manufacturing facility near the Kennedy Space Center and to launch the boosters 
    from the nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.<br>
    Launch complex 36 will be refurbished to support the Blue Origin launch vehicle. 
    The BE-4 test stand will be built nearby, along with a processing facility to 
    prepare the boosters for flight.<br>
    A much larger building, where the rockets will actually be built, will be located 
    on Merritt Island, just south of the Kennedy Space Center, in an aerospace industrial 
    park on state property. <br>
    Jeff Bezos declined to provide performance details about the </font><b>
    <font size="2" color="#FF0000">new orbital-rocket</font></b><font size="2" color="#FF0000">,</font><font size="2" color="#000080"> 
    how much weight it will be able to boost to low-Earth orbit, when unpiloted 
    test flights might begin or when crewed missions might fly. He promised more 
    details about the rocket next year.<br>
    The orbital rocket will consist of two stages, one powered by the BE-4 and the 
    other, presumably, by the BE-3. As currently envisioned, only the first stage 
    will be reusable. Both the orbital launcher and the New Shepard booster will 
    feature autonomous abort systems to quickly pull a crew or cargo capsule away 
    from a malfunctioning rocket.<br>
    Blue Origin and United launch Alliance last week announced an agreement to expand 
    production of the BE-4 to support ULA&#39;s Vulcan rocket.</font><font size="2" color="#800080"><b><br>
