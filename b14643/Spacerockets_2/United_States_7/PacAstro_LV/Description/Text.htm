was founded in 1989 to develop the PA-2 small launch vehicle to provide low cost 
access to space. The PA-2 vehicle was designed to deliver a 500 to 1000 lbm payload 
to low earth orbit. To achieve this goal, PacAstro developed and demonstrated a 
suite of new technologies in the mid-nineties. Some of these new technologies include 
composite propellant tanks, specifically an composite liquid oxygen tank, composite 
fuel tanks, and a high performance large composite helium tank, and an advanced 
high performance, low-cost rocket engine. These technologies were successfully demonstrated 
in the PA-X suborbital rocket program and the PA-E rocket engine program.<br>
<br>
PacAstro was spun off from its parent company, AeroAstro Inc., in 2003 in preparation 
for the 2004 merger with Aspect Engineering. In 2005, the PacAstro Lab office in 
Waveland, MS was destroyed in hurricane Katrina. As a result, PacAstro Lab opened 
its current office in Tullahoma, TN, next to the campus of the University of Tennessee 
Space Institute (UTSI) and is working with UTSI on a variety of joint research projects.</font></p>

was formed in early 2004 from a merger of PacAstro and Aspect Engineering, and has 
offices in Tullahoma, TN and Murrieta, CA. Since this merger, the company has established 
several new Laboratories to develop new products and capabilities.<br>
<br>
Gloyer-Taylor Laboratories LLC is focused on the development and commercialization 
of promising technologies in areas including aerospace, propulsion, structures, 
biomedical and commercial products. The company is organized into specialized Labs, 
which are focused on specific opportunities. Key aerospace Labs include:<br>
<b>Flandro Stability Lab</b> is focused on the application of the breakthrough UCDS 
capability to eliminate the high cost and risk of combustion instability which has 
plagued the propulsion industry.<br>
<b>PacAstro Lab</b> is focused on developing rocket propulsion technologies and 
associated products. Past efforts include the PA-X Suborbital Rocket, and the PA-E15k 
and PA-E30k rocket engines. Current efforts include NORSE rocket system, the GTV 
high performance monopropellant, and the QpV hybrid rocket. <br>
<b>Aspect Engineering Lab</b> is focused on developing innovative composite structure 
technologies and approaches for use in aerospace systems. Past efforts include the 
Common Bulkhead Integral Structure developed for Orbital Sciences Corporation for 
use on the AFRL Upper Stage Flight Experiment (USFE) rocket system. Current efforts 
include the development of a high pressure composite liquid oxygen tank.<br>

<p align="left"><font size="2" color="#000080"><b>PA-X Suborbital Rocket</b><br>
This Using a combination of commercial IR&amp;D and Phase I &amp; II SBIR funds, PacAstro 
developed the 33 ft long, 3 ft diameter PA-X suborbital rocket as a technology demonstration 
vehicle. Some of the innovative technologies in PA-X included:<br>
<br>
• A simple, low-cost pressure-fed propellant feed system<br>
• A high-performance 3 ft diameter, 19 cu ft volume, 5000 psi carbon/epoxy composite 
helium tank with integral skirt<br>
• A 3 ft diameter, 19 cu ft volume, plastic-lined, carbon/epoxy composite fuel tank 
with integral skirt<br>
• A high-performance, 3 ft diameter, 33 cu ft volume, 500 psi composite LOX tank 
with an aluminum liner and carbon/epoxy overwrap, with an integral skirt.<br>
• Low-cost composite fairing and tail structures<br>
• Low-cost, high-performance 15,000 lbf thrust PA-E rocket engine</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" color="#000080">While PA-X was not flown, the effort 
verified the capabilities of many of the innovative technologies, including the 
successful cycling of a sub-scale aluminum-lined, carbon/epoxy overwrapped LOX tank.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" color="#000080"><b>PA-2 Small Launch Vehicle</b><br>
In the mid-90’s, PacAstro was actively developing the PA-2 small launch vehicle. 
While PA-2 specific hardware was not produced, key technologies were demonstrated 
in the PA-E and PA-X development efforts. Development of the PA-2 was put on hold 
in the late 90’s due to funding constraints and a realization that a $6M per launch 
price was too high to effectively change the space launch market paradigm.<br>
Key features of the PA-2 Small Launch Vehicle were:<br>
• Two-stage, LOX/RP-1 vehicle<br>
• Composite fuel, LOX and Helium tanks<br>
• Helium pressure fed system<br>
• Upperstage Engine = PA-E15k<br>
• Boosterstage Engine = PA-E120k</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" color="#000080"><b>PA-E Liquid Rocket Engine</b><br>
The low-cost, high-performance PA-E15k rocket engine (LOX/RP-1) was developed by 
PacAstro as the upperstage engine for the PA-2 small launch vehicle and was used 
as the engine for the PA-X suborbital rocket. The PA-E15k engine incorporates several 
innovative technologies to achieve high-performance and low-cost in a robust package, 
including a liquid oxygen cooled injector and an ablatively cooled chamber. <br>
<br>
In parallel with the successful PA-E15k development and test effort, the engine 
design was modified to operate at higher chamber pressures. While the resulting 
PA-E30k engine was not test fired, a prototype of the engine was fabricated.</font></p>
