<br>
The design of the H-1800 has a planned average vacuum thrust of 1,003 kN, and average 
vacuum Isp design goal of 2724 N*s/kg. The nozzle of the engine DM-01 is fixed, 
with thrust vectoring by LOX injection through the side of the silica-phenolic nozzle. 
Each of the H-1800 motors weighs 36.97 tons fully fueled, with 9.98 tons of HTPB 
propellant and 22.00 tons of oxygen. The U-75 is a Amroc hybrid rocket using self-pressurizing 
pressure-fed nitrous oxide (N2O) as the oxidiser.<br>
Aquila-21 will lift 0.907 tons into LEO from Vandenberg. The first suborbital test 
was scheduled for 1995.<br>

</font><font size="1">&quot;James C. Bennett, a principal in US hybrid rocket research 
and development, co-founded Space Enterprise Consultants in 1980, and Arc Technologies, 
Inc., later known as Starstruck, Inc. Starstruck successfully conducted a sea launch 
of its <font color="#FF0000">Dolphin</font> rocket on August 3, 1984 with a thrust 
of 175.00 kN using HTPB and LOX. This Dolphin launch produced two notable firsts: 
the first flight of a privately developed large launch vehicle in the US, and the 
first flight of a large hybrid rocket. In 1985, Mr. Bennett co-founded American 
Rocket Company (Amroc), which tested engines up to 324.00 kN, and unsuccessfully 
launched the SET-1 sounding rocket on October 5, 1989, which failed for reasons 
unrelated to the hybrid motor. Amroc folded in 1995, but SpaceDev acquired rights 
to Amroc&#39;s hybrid technology in 1999, and continues to develop hybrid technology.&quot;<br>
&quot;Starstruck (formerly ARC Technology, a predecessor to Amroc) developed the hybrid 
fueled (polybutadiene and liquid oxygen) Dolphin. It was also launched from a floating 
launch cannister at sea. One successful suborbital flight was made 03.08.1984, but 
the project ran out of money, as it was backed entirely with private funds, which 
did not suffice for further development.&quot;</font><i><font size="1"><br>

In August 1998 </font><font color="#FF0000" size="2">Space Development Com. (SpaceDev)</font><font size="2" color="#000080">, 
the world&#39;s first commercial space exploration company, acquired exclusive rights 
to intellectual property including the three patents originally issued to American 
Rocket Company (Amroc) for their hybrid rocket motor technology. In addition, SpaceDev 
acquired exclusive possession of and access to a large quantity of Amroc engineering 
documents, plans, designs, test results, manufacturing data, and other materials 
related to the rocket motors and Amroc launch vehicles.<br>
The USAF Research Laboratory awarded a contract to SpaceDev to design and develop 
a low cost small launch vehicle, dubbed </font><font size="2" color="#FF0000">Streaker</font><font size="2" color="#000080">. 
The hybrid vehicle will offer quick response launches of payloads in the 500-kilogram 
(1,102-pound) class to LEO.<br>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" color="#000080">The SpaceDev 
Streaker will use patented High Performance Mass Fraction hybrid common core boosters 
that will equal the performance of solid rocket motors and some liquid rocket motors 
while remaining safe, responsive and affordable. The rocket motors burn HTPB (tire 
rubber) and Laughing Gas (nitrous oxide), and will be augmented by existing technologies 
to produce performance significantly above traditional hybrid motors.<br>
<span class="BTX">SpaceDev has signed a lease to expand its fabrication and test 
facilities and to begin constructing portable, high tech rocket motor test support 
equipment in anticipation of test firing new rocket motors that SpaceDev is developing 
for its low-cost expendable small launch vehicle called SpaceDev Streaker.<br>
Under an Air Force Research Laboratory contract, SpaceDev will begin development 
of the SpaceDev Streaker Hybrid Upper Stage rocket motor. This motor is expected 
to produce approximately 20,000 pounds of thrust, in contrast to the 15,000 pounds 
of thrust produced by SpaceDev&#39;s hybrid rocket motor technology for Paul Allen&#39;s 
SpaceShipOne.<br>
In addition, the Company plans to boost overall performance of this upper stage 
motor using new techniques and refining current techniques that go beyond that of 
traditional hybrid motors.<br>
The additional SpaceDev facility will be located in Poway, California. It will add 
approximately 11,000 square feet of fabrication space in which we will construct 
rocket motor development equipment that will be highly adaptable and mobile.</span></font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" color="#000080">A test 
stand will be designed to support the 20,000 pounds of thrust produced by the Hybrid 
Upper Stage motor, and the 120,000 pounds of thrust expected to be produced by the 
SpaceDev Streaker Small Common Booster motor.<br>
<br>
SpaceDev design for a restartable hybrid propulsion space tug or upper stage. The 
MoTV was the SpaceDev Maneuvering and orbital Transfer Vehicle. It used a hybrid 
motor based on HTPB for fuel and N2O (nitrous oxide) as an oxidizer. Features included: 
Total impulse could be controlled by burn length (significant advantage over solids); 
oxidizer could be used for cold-gas attitude thrusters (for steering); could be 
used for multiple burns.<br>

SpaceDev currently plans to use variations of both the Hybrid Upper Stage and the 
Small Common Booster motors in &quot;</font><font size="2" color="#FF0000">SpaceDev</font><font size="2" color="#000080">

along with Large Common Boosters in the orbital version of SpaceDev Dream Chaser. 
The reuseable, piloted, sub-orbital space ship that could be scaled up to safely 
and economically transport passengers to and from low earth orbit, including the 
International Space Station. The SpaceDev Dream Chaser would be piloted and take-off 
vertically, like most launch vehicles, and is designed to glide back for a normal 
horizontal runway landing.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" color="#000080">The sub-orbital 
SpaceDev Dream Chaser is derived from an existing X-Plane concept, will have an 
altitude goal of approximately 160 km (about 100 miles) and will be powered by a 
single, high performance hybrid rocket motor, under parallel development by SpaceDev 
for the SpaceDev Streaker, a family of small, expendable launch vehicles, designed 
to affordably deliver small satellites to low earth orbit. The SpaceDev Dream Chaser 
will use motor technology being developed for the SpaceDev Streaker booster stage, 
the most powerful motor in the Streaker family. The SpaceDev Dream Chaser motor 
will produce approximately 100,000 pounds of thrust, about six times the thrust 
of the SpaceShipOne motor, but less than one-half that of the 250,000 pound thrust 
hybrid rocket motors developed several years ago by the American Rocket Company 
(Amroc).</font></p>
<p align="left"><b>SpaceDev selected for V.G. SpaceShip engine<font size="2"><br>
</font></b><font size="2" color="#000080">Scaled Composites, developers of the SpaceShipOne 
(SS1) reusable suborbital spacecraft, announced that they had selected SpaceDev 
to provide the propulsion system for the vehicle. SpaceDev was in competition with 
another company, Environmental Aeroscience Corporation (eAc), to build the hybrid 
propellant engine that will be used to boost SS1 onto a suborbital trajectory once 
it its released from its White Knight carrier aircraft. Both SpaceDev and eAc had 
successfully tested their versions of the engine, using nitrous oxide and hydroxy-terminated 
polybutadiene (HTPB), or rubber, as propellants.<br>
<br>
</font><font size="2" color="#800080"><b>2014 change of motor</b><br>
In May 2014, Virgin Galactic announced a change to the hybrid motor to be used in 
SpaceShipTwo, and took the development effort in-house, terminating the contract 
with Sierra Nevada and halting all development on the first-generation rocket motor 
for SpaceShipTwo.<br>
<br>
Virgin Galactic says it&#39;s switching from a rubber-based solid fuel to a plastic-based 
fuel for the motor. The new motor would now use thermoplastic polyamide (i.e., nylon) 
as the solid fuel component of the propellant.<br>
The plastic fuel was projected to have better performance and was expected to allow 
SpaceShipTwo to make flights to a higher altitude.</font></p>
