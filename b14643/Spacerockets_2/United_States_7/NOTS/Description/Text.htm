NOTS-EV-I Pilot</font><font size="2" color="#000080"> rocket was a five-stage vehicle, 
but NOTSNIK is sometimes called a six-stage system, when the launching aircraft 
is counted as the first stage. All Pilot launches used a modified F4D-1 Skyray fighter, 
which carried the NOTS-EV-1 on an underwing pylon. The rocket was released in a 
50° zoom climb at a speed of 740 km/h (460 mph) at an altitude of 12500 m (41,000 
ft). The first and second stages of the rocket used a common airframe, and consisted 
of two HOTROC solid-fueled motors each, mounted diagonally opposed in a two-by-two 
pattern. Three seconds after release, the first stage fired for 4.9 seconds, followed 
by 12 seconds of coasting and the firing of the second stage. At about 80 km (50 
miles) altitude, the first/second stage structure was jettisoned, followed by a 
36 second burn of the ABL X-241 third stage. The fourth stage was a small NOTS-100 
solid rocket, which burned for 5.7 seconds and placed the payload into an &quot;orbit&quot; 
with an extremely low perigee (about 2400 x 60 km (1500 x 37 miles). The perigee 
was raised to a safe 2250 km (1400 miles) by the fifth stage, a tiny motor integrated 
with the payload. The latter had a diameter of 20 cm (8 in), weighed only 1.05 kg 
(2.3 lb) and had a single instrument, a very primitive infrared line-scanning device 
to make crude IR images of the ground. This device effectively meant that the NOTSNIK 
satellite could be seen as a space-based surveillance platform, and therefore the 
whole effort was top secret at that time.<br>
After two failed ground launches of the first/second stage HOTROC motors in early 
July 1958, the first air-launch of a Pilot vehicle was attempted on 25 July. The 
launch was successful as long as the vehicle was visually tracked, but there was 
no confirmed radio contact afterwards. During August 1958, five additional NOTSNIK 
launches were attempted, but all except one ended very early after release of the 
rocket because of failures of a rocket motor and/or the vehicle&#39;s structure. On 
that second possibly successful flight, on 22 August, again no definite radio contact 
could be established with the possibly orbiting payload. Although it is reported 
that ground stations received a few very weak signals, which could have come from 
the satellite, it remains very doubtful whether the payload did actually reach the 
planned orbit.<br>

Project </font><font size="2" color="#FF0000">Caleb</font><font size="2" color="#000080"> 
was a follow-on program to the Pilot (NOTSNIK) program of the Naval Ordnance Test 
Station (NOTS) at China Lake. Originally, the Caleb vehicle, also designated
</font><font size="2" color="#FF0000">NOTS-EV-II</font><font size="2" color="#000080">, 
was to be a launcher for small orbital payloads, like quick-reaction reconnaissance 
satellites. However, the orbital Caleb program was soon cancelled, reportedly because 
of pressure from the USAF which wanted to monopolize the satellite launching program. 
The NOTS-EV-2 was designed as an air-launched four-stage all-solid rocket vehicle. 
The stages were a NOTS-500, an ABL X-248, a NOTS-100A and a small spherical NOTS 
motor.<br>
The first test launch, with one live stage only, occurred on 28 July 1960 from an 
F4D-1 Skyray aircraft (the same as used for the Pilot tests), and was successful. 
A second flight in October that year was to fly a vehicle with two live stages, 
but the second one failed to ignite. Starting on 5 October 1961, three sub-orbital 
two-stage Caleb rockets were launched under the U.S. Navy&#39;s Hi-Hoe sounding rocket 
program. These flights used an F4H-1 (F-4B) Phantom aircraft for higher performance. 
The first two Hi-Hoe flights were unsuccessful because of upper-stage failures, 
but the final one on 26 July 1962 reached an altitude of 1167 km (725 miles). The 
Caleb vehicles for Hi-Hoe were of a significantly modified design, but the drawing 
is apparently of a proposal for a sounding rocket based on the AIR-2 Genie. <br>
The NOTS-EV-2 rocket was also used in the SIP (Satellite Interceptor Program) project, 
an attempt to develop an air-launched ASAT (anti-satellite) missile. Two NOTS-EV-2 
vehicles were ground-launched in SIP-related tests in October 1961 and May 1962, 
respectively. The ASAT project was possibly also known as &quot;NOTSNIK II&quot;.</font></p>
