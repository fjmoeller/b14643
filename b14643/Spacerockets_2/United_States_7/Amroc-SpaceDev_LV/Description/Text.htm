The design of the H-1800 has a planned average vacuum thrust of 1,003 kN, and average

with thrust vectoring by LOX injection through the side of the silica-phenolic nozzle. 
Each of the H-1800 motors weighs 36.97 tons fully fueled, with 9.98 tons of HTPB 
propellant and 22.00 tons of oxygen. The U-75 is a Amroc hybrid rocket using self-pressurizing 
pressure-fed nitrous oxide (N2O) as the oxidiser.<br>
Aquila-21 will lift 0.907 tons into LEO from Vandenberg. The first suborbital test 
was scheduled for 1995.</font></font></p>

  to a large quantity of Amroc engineering documents, plans, designs, test results, 
  manufacturing data, and other materials related to the rocket motors and Amroc

  SpaceDev Streaker will use patented High Performance Mass Fraction hybrid common 
  core boosters that will equal the performance of solid rocket motors and some 
  liquid rocket motors while remaining safe, responsive and affordable. The rocket 
  motors burn HTPB (tire rubber) and Laughing Gas (nitrous oxide), and will be augmented 
  by existing technologies to produce performance significantly above traditional 
  hybrid motors.<br>
  <span class="BTX">SpaceDev has signed a lease to expand its fabrication and test 
  facilities and to begin constructing portable, high tech rocket motor test support 
  equipment in anticipation of test firing new rocket motors that SpaceDev is developing 
  for its low-cost expendable small launch vehicle called SpaceDev Streaker.<br>
  Under an Air Force Research Laboratory contract, SpaceDev will begin development 
  of the SpaceDev Streaker Hybrid Upper Stage rocket motor. This motor is expected 
  to produce approximately 20,000 pounds of thrust, in contrast to the 15,000 pounds 
  of thrust produced by SpaceDev&#39;s hybrid rocket motor technology for Paul Allen&#39;s 
  SpaceShipOne.<br>
  In addition, the Company plans to boost overall performance of this upper stage 
  motor using new techniques and refining current techniques that go beyond that 
  of traditional hybrid motors.<br>
  The additional SpaceDev facility will be located in Poway, California. It will 
  add approximately 11,000 square feet of fabrication space in which we will construct 
  rocket motor development equipment that will be highly adaptable and mobile.</span></font></p>

  SpaceDev currently plans to use variations of both the Hybrid Upper Stage and

spacecraft, announced that they had selected SpaceDev to provide the propulsion 
system for the vehicle. SpaceDev was in competition with another company, Environmental 
Aeroscience Corporation (eAc), to build the hybrid propellant engine that will be 
used to boost SS1 onto a suborbital trajectory once it its released from its White 
Knight carrier aircraft. Both SpaceDev and eAc had successfully tested their versions 
of the engine, using nitrous oxide and hydroxy-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB), 
or rubber, as propellants. <br>

&quot;James C. Bennett, a principal in US hybrid rocket research and development, co-founded 
Space Enterprise Consultants in 1980, and Arc Technologies, Inc., later known as

<font size="2">rocket </font></font><font color="#000080" size="2">on August 3, 
1984 with a thrust of 175.00 kN using HTPB and LOX. This Dolphin launch produced 
two notable firsts: the first flight of a privately developed large launch vehicle 
in the US, and the first flight of a large hybrid rocket. In 1985, Mr. Bennett co-founded 
American Rocket Company (Amroc), which tested engines up to 324.00 kN, and unsuccessfully 
launched the SET-1 sounding rocket on October 5, 1989, which failed for reasons 
unrelated to the hybrid motor. Amroc folded in 1995, but SpaceDev acquired rights 
to Amroc&#39;s hybrid technology in 1999, and continues to develop hybrid technology.&quot;<br>
&quot;Starstruck (formerly ARC Technology, a predecessor to Amroc) developed the hybrid 
fueled (polybutadiene and liquid oxygen) Dolphin. It </font>
<font color="#000080"><font size="2">was also launched from a floating launch cannister 
at sea. One successful suborbital flight was made 03.08.1984, but the project ran

SpaceDev’s founding chairman and CEO, Jim Benson, recently signed a Space Act Memorandum 
of Understanding (MOU) with NASA Ames Research Center director, Dr. Scott Hubbard. 
This non-binding MOU confirms the intention of the two parties to explore novel, 
hybrid propulsion based hypersonic test beds for routine human space access. The 
parties will explore collaborative partnerships to investigate the potential of 
using SpaceDev’s proven hybrid propulsion and other technologies, and a low cost, 
private space program development approach, to establish and design new piloted 
small launch vehicles and flight test platforms to enable near-term, low-cost routine 
space access for NASA and the United States. One possibility for collaboration is 
the SpaceDev Dream Chaser project, which is currently being discussed with NASA 
Ames.<br>
Unlike the more complex SpaceShipOne, for which SpaceDev provides critical proprietary 
hybrid rocket motor propulsion technologies, the SpaceDev Dream Chaser would be 
piloted and take-off vertically, like most launch vehicles, and is designed to glide 
back for a normal horizontal runway landing.<br>
The sub-orbital SpaceDev Dream Chaser is derived from an existing X-Plane concept, 
will have an altitude goal of approximately 160 km (about 100 miles) and will be 
powered by a single, high performance hybrid rocket motor, under parallel development 
by SpaceDev for the SpaceDev Streaker, a family of small, expendable launch vehicles, 
designed to affordably deliver small satellites to low earth orbit. The SpaceDev 
Dream Chaser will use motor technology being developed for the SpaceDev Streaker 
booster stage, the most powerful motor in the Streaker family. The SpaceDev Dream 
Chaser motor will produce approximately 100,000 pounds of thrust, about six times 
the thrust of the SpaceShipOne motor, but less than one-half that of the 250,000 
pound thrust hybrid rocket motors developed several years ago by the American Rocket 
Company (Amroc).</font></p>
