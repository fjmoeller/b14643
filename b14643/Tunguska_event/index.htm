      explosion that occurred near the Podkamennaya Tunguska river in Yeniseysk 
      Governorate (now Krasnoyarsk Krai) in Siberia, on the morning of June 30, 
      1908. The explosion over the sparsely populated Eastern Siberian Taiga flattened 
      an estimated 60 million trees over an area of 2,000 km<sup>2</sup> of forest.

      </font><font size="4" color="#000080">Around 7:00 a.m., a glowing object appeared 
      in the clear summer sky, the shape of which was similar to a cylinder or a 
      beam and whose brightness was compared with the sun. According to eyewitnesses, 
      the object appeared at the level of the low sun in the east. The brilliantly 
      bright object poisy across the sky and disappeared on the western horizon. 
      At the point where the object had disappeared, the sky lit up and there a 
      high cloud of smoke appeared. After that, strange detonations could be heard 
      and the earth shook far from the explosion site. A bright glow of fire, a 
      strong shock, a pressure wave and thunder noises were perceived even at a 
      great distance.<br>
      </font><font color="#000080" size="2"><br>
      </font><font size="4" color="#000080">Locals saw this &quot;second sun&quot; relatively 
      close to the explosion site. After violent explosions, earthquakes and hot 
      squalls were registered. Further observations suggest that at least two other 
      objects coming from the south and west led to explosions, which lasted about 
      an hour with breaks.<br>
      The seismographs registered the tremors in all meteorological stations in 
      Europe and North America. During the strangely bright nights that followed, 
      silver shining clouds of an extraordinary sheen appeared over Eastern and 
      Western Europe.<br>

      in 1930, which was the first to document the enormous damage in the taiga, 
      there have been several other expeditions to investigate the cause of the 
      explosions. To date, however, there is no useful scientific information. Neither 
      craters nor remains of meteoric material were found. All previous attempts 
      to design a scenario of the event are for the trash, or at least questionable. 
      Based on the dramatic reports of eyewitnesses, we only know that glistening 
      bright &quot;objects&quot; passing the atmosphere dissolved completely in strange explosions 
      near the earth&#39;s surface and that there was a bright night in the wider area

      <p align="center"><b><font size="6" color="#000080">An electric discharge 
      between the earth surface and a hot plasma</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><b><font color="#000080">From the sum of the observations 
      I derive my theory that the Tunguska event was the explosions of &quot;hot&quot; plasma. 
      It probably originates from the boundary layer between the ionosphere and 
      the plasmasphere of the earth and was transported along lines of the magnetic 
      field to a strongly positively charged hotspot on the earth&#39;s surface (Tunguska 
      region), where explosive discharges took place.<br>
      <br>
      The plasmasphere is the inner, to a torus closed part in the terrestrial magnetosphere 
      and is filled with a relatively dense and cold plasma. It consists of ionized 
      atomic nuclei (ions) with a critical mass of released electrons and is fed 
      from the ionosphere. It is electrically conductive, but is in energetic equilibrium.<br>
      Recent satellite observations have shown that irregularities in density in 
      the form of clouds or imperfections can form in the plasmasphere. New observations 
      have also shown that the plasma could be in principle arranged like a tube 
      along the field lines of the magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      The &quot;cold&quot; plasma can become the &quot;hot&quot; plasma if significantly more energy 
      is supplied. The energetic equilibrium is considerably disturbed by more electrons 
      released from the already ionized atomic nuclei (ions). The ionization increases. 
      This plasma lights up when free electrons are captured again by the ions, 
      releasing the previoisly absorbed energy in the form of light.</font></b></p>
      <p align="left"><font color="#000080"><b><u><font size="5">The scenario of 
      the Tunguska event could be described as follows:</font><font size="4"><br>
      </font></u><br>
      </b><font size="4">In the bright nights (perceived above the taiga before 
      the event), a plume of cold plasma in the lower plasma sphere at the border 
      to the ionosphere rapidly became negatively charged. The observed light phenomena 
      document energetic interactions within the plasma. A plume of strongly negatively 
      charged plasma along magnetic field lines reached an equally strongly positively 
      charged (</font></font><font size="4"><font color="#FF0000">magnetic<b>*</b></font><font color="#000080">) 
      hotspot in Siberia on June 30, 1908. Due to the objects arriving from four 
      (?) points of the compass (turned by 90°) combined with violent explosions, 
      it can be assumed that the plasma was split up (&quot;tubes&quot;) and reached this 
      strongly positively charged part in the Tunguska region at various times. 
      The apparently &quot;flat&quot; trajectories of the objects can be explained by the 
      fact that there has been a diversion towards the positive hotspot.<br>
      </font><b><font color="#FF0000">*</font></b><i><font color="#000080">
      </font><u>Note</u>: The Tunguska explosion is located on the southern edge 
      of the Siberian Trapp with an exceptional accumulation of

      as </font><b><font color="#FF0000">electric discharges</font></b><font color="#000080">, 
      comparable to the mechanism the &quot;</font><b><font color="#FF0000">Townsend 
      Avalanche</font></b><font color="#000080">&quot;, in which there is an avalanche-like 
      reaction between &quot;hot&quot; plasma and a positively charged hotspot. A multitude 
      of repetitive noises such as popping, knocking and rattling could indicate 
      the decaying electrical discharges.<br>
      </font></font><font color="#000080"><font size="2"><br>
      </font><font size="4">An object that came with a roar from the east was perceived 
      as a beam or tube. The statement that a &quot;devil with two eyes&quot; came from the 
      south (?) could be a sighting of two tubes. Statements about a divided sky 
      also suggest tubes.<br>
      The bright night sky, which was still be seen over Europe for days, is an 
      indication of the spread of other charged plasma, which however, as in the 
      case of Tunguska, did not reach the earth&#39;s surface. The insignificant column 
      of smoke above the Tunguska cannot be the cause of the glow.<br>
      Remarkable, in Irkutsk (almost 950 km away from the Tunguska epicenter) a 
      geomagnetic disturbance was registered which lasted for several hours.
      </font><b><br>
      <font size="2"><br>
      </font></b>In order to give weight to this theory, however, the cause of the 
      energy supply in the case of plasma in the plasmasphere should be clarified, 
      as well as the fact that the plasma leaves the plasmasphere and passed the 
      ionosphere und finally reaches the earth&#39;s surface along magnetic field lines.</font></p>

          </b>The avalanche occurs in a gaseous medium that can be ionised (Plasma). 
          The electric field and the mean free path of the electron must allow free 
          electrons to acquire an energy level (velocity) that can cause impact 
          ionisation.<br>
          The electric field is applied across a gaseous medium; initial ions are 
          created with ionising radiation (for example, cosmic rays). An original 
          ionisation event produces an ion pair; the positive ion accelerates towards 
          the cathode while the free electron accelerates towards the anode. If 
          the electric field is strong enough, the free electron can gain sufficient 
          velocity (energy) to liberate another electron when it next collides with 
          a molecule. The two free electrons then travel towards the anode and gain 
          sufficient energy from the electric field to cause further impact ionisations, 
          and so on. This process is effectively a chain reaction that generates 
          free electrons. Initially, the number of collisions grows exponentially.</font></i></td>

      A certain <i>Semonov</i> was at the Vanavara trading post (about 40 kilometers 
      south of the explosion) and suddenly saw that directly to the north, the sky 
      was split in two and fire appeared high and far above the forest. The split 
      in the sky widened and the entire northern horizon was covered with fire. 
      Heat came from the north. Then the sky closed and a strong thump sounded and 
      he was thrown a few meters. Then came a sound like stones falling or cannons 
      shooting, the earth shook. As the sky opened, a hot wind raced between the 
      houses.</p>
      <p>The Evenk brothers <i>Chekaren and Chunchanka</i> reported: We slept in 
      our tent. We suddenly woke up. Somebody pushed us. We heard whistling and 
      felt a strong wind. We couldn&#39;t see what was going on outside in the tent. 
      Suddenly I was pushed again, this time so hard that I fell into the fire. 
      There was noise behind the tent, we could hear trees falling. We wanted out, 
      but then the thunder struck. This was the first thunder. The earth began to 
      move and rock, the wind overturned our tent. Then I saw trees fall and branches 
      burn, it grew mighty light, as if there was a second sun. And immediately 
      there was a loud clap of thunder. This was the second thunder. Our sun was 
      shining brightly as always and suddenly another one came. Then we saw that 
      in another place there was another lightning and loud thunder came. This was 
      the third clap of thunder. The wind came again, knocked us off our feet. Suddenly 
      we saw another lightning bolt, followed by another thunder. But the noise 
      was less than before. This was the fourth thunder. I can still remember there 
      was another clap of thunder, but it was quieter and somewhere far to the west.</p>
      <p align="left">Newspaper &quot;Sibir&quot;, July 2, 1908: On the morning of June 30, 
      around 7:00 a.m., residents of the settlement Karelinski (213 km north of 
      Kirensk) in the northwest, quite high above the horizon, observed some strangely 
      bright (impossible to look on.) bluish-white objects moving down for 10 minutes. 
      One object appeared as a &quot;tube&quot; (cylinder). As the object approached the ground 
      (forest), the light-colored body seemed to smear and then turned into a huge 
      cloud of black smoke, and a loud knock was heard, as if large stones were 
      falling or artillery was being fired. At the same time, the cloud began to 
      emit flames with irregular shapes. An observer was in the forest about 4 kilometers 
      north of Kirensk and heard this type of artillery fire in the northwest, repeating 
      at least 10 times every 15 minutes.</p>
      <p align="left">Newspaper &quot;Krasnoyarets&quot;, July 13, 1908: Kezhemskoe settlement 
      (northwest of Illimsk). At 7:43 a.m. the sound of a strong wind was heard. 
      Immediately thereafter, there was a terrible thud, followed by an earthquake 
      that literally shook the buildings. The first blow was followed by a second 
      and then a third. The pause between the first and third beat was accompanied 
      by an unusual underground rattle, similar to a railroad where dozens of trains 
      run at the same time. After that, a similarity of artillery fire could be 
      heard for 5 to 6 minutes: 50 to 60 shots at short, equal intervals, which 
      became progressively weaker. After 1.5 to 2 minutes after one of the &quot;barrages&quot;, 
      six more blows could be heard, like cannon fire, but individual, loud and 
      accompanied by tremors. In the north, where most of the beating could be heard, 
      a kind of ashen cloud could be seen near the horizon, which became smaller 
      and more transparent and disappeared completely after hours.</p>
      <p align="left">Nizshne-Karelinskoye (465 km, 133°). Extremely bright (it 
      was impossible to look at it) luminous body was seen rather high in the north-western 
      sky soon after 8 a.m. It looked like a tube (cylinder) and for 10 minutes 
      moved down to the ground. The sky was clear, but only in the side, where the 
      body was seen, a small dark cloud was present low above the horizon. While 
      coming to the ground, the body dispersed (flattened) and at this place a large 
      puff of black smoke appeared. Then a flame emanated from this cloud.</p>
      <p align="left">Nizshne-Ilimskoye (419 km, 168°). The fireball was seen which 
      while going to the ground at first flattened into&quot;flying saucer&quot;. Then coming 
      nearer to the ground it transformed into 2 fire columns. <br>
      Os&#39;kino (330 km, 89°). Innokentii Farkov said a gradually rising boom coming 
      from afar was heard since morning hours. The old men, thinking their dying 
      hours had come, were changing into clean shirts, and one of them even washed 
      in the bath house to meet the death clean. The ground trembled as a black 
      body flew past, trailing a fiery tail.</p>
      <p align="left">Kezhma (214 km, 193°). In Kezhma was to see a flying luminous 
      cloud, multicolored luminous bands, a fireball, a flame over the northern 
      horizon. For example, A. K. Kokorin, the observer of the Kezhma meteorological 
      station marked in the observational register that at 7 a.m. two giant fiery 
      circles appeared on the north. They persisted for 4 minutes and then disappeared. 
      Soon after, noise, like a wind was heard. It came from the north to the south 
      and its duration was 5 minutes. Then other sounds, resembling large cannon 
      shots and crackling appeared. These shots continued for 2 minutes, then a 
      crackling like a gun shot appeared and persisted for 2 minutes. The sky was 
      clear.</p>
      <p align="left">Tetere (92 km, 165). Fire columns were seen in the north.</p>

      The Russian ethnographer <i>Vainshtein</i> had been collected a remarkable 
      account during his 1948 expedition to the settlement of Sulomay (61.6°N, 91.2°E) 
      which is situated about 577 km west of the Tunguska epicentre. The native
      <i>Tyganov</i> reported that for one or even two nights before the Tunguska 
      event (he did not remember precisely) the night sky was extraordinarily bright. 
      The next morning, he saw with horror &quot;the second Sun,&quot; as he described it, 
      flying from the left bank of the Podkamennaya Tunguska River—brighter than 
      the one we all know (it was painful for eyes to look at). At the same time, 
      there was a strong rumble.. &quot;The second Sun&quot; quickly moved across the sky. 
      Soon after that, a bright fire without smoke rose to the sky and a deafening 
      explosion sounded, from Vanavara&#39;s side. The earth began to tremble, and a 
      strong wind swept in. The wind uprooted tall trees nesr Sulomay. Then everything 
      abated, the sky was still bright for one or two nights.</p>
      <p>There is a further account from the settlement of Podkamennaya Tunguska 
      (western distance of 632 km from the Tunguska epicentre). The account stated 
      seeing (early in the morning in 1908) a lengthy fiery strip flashing across 
      the sky, and hearing accompanying thunder that sounded as if it came from 
      a cannon.</p>
      <p>Much closer to the Tunguska epicentre, there is a account stating that 
      a fireball moved from the west, then descended to Chuvar (a large ridge), 
      and then went down. Also, the fireball scorched and unrooted trees, but did 
      not fall from the sky. Instead, it went further away. The position of the 
      Chuvar ridge is at a western distance of 23 km from the Tunguska epicentre. 
      A strip-like forest fall was noted on this ridge in 1959.</p>

      Probably the strangest report comes from the hunter <i>Aksenov</i>, who found 
      himself on June 30 near the mouth of a tributary of the Chamba, about 40 km 
      south of the epicenter of the disaster. It is the description of a &quot;flying 
      devil with two eyes&quot; who flew over him along the Chamba and made a sound &quot;troo-troo&quot;. 
      It is unclear whether the trajectory of the object ran from south to north 
      or vice versa. The &quot;down the Chamba&quot; is ambiguous. It can mean the course 
      of the river or also the down-fall over the northern part the Chamba.<p align="left">
